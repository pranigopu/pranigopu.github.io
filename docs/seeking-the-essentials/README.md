# Seeking the Essentials
## About
Grasping the essentials of an area of interest helps integrate our knowledge to a broader context, allowing for more effective action in the long-range and in the bigger picture of our own lives, i.e. allowing for more effective action with respect to the whole truth that we can grasp. This website showcases some of my writings done in the subjects of applied and theoretical philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics and politics), statistics and computer science. The nature of my writings here is based on a two interrelated goals: to gain theoretical clarity and to understand the practical application of ideas I find relevant to human life. Theory forms the bedrock and basis for practice, and practice reaffirms and expands on theory. I regard both as indispensable and aim to cover both aspects in my writings overall.

My predominant philosophical inspiration is the philosophy of Ayn Rand (which is called "Objectivism"), whose fundamentals I accept wholeheartedly (after having validated it myself, i.e. first-hand). I have not read nor validated all of Ayn Rand’s works in every area, so my acceptance of her work and her words is limited to her philosophical groundwork and whatever other ideas of hers I have validated myself. However, my philosophy-related work is not primarily meant to explain her ideas but to use her ideas (after validating them) to expand on and clarify certain key topics of my choice, mostly morality and epistemology. Even when the ideas and arguments I use are essentially hers, the works in this website represent my own views. Hence, do not take my work to be necessarily representative of Ayn Rand’s philosophy as she has presented it.

The other philosopher whose works I have studied to some extent is Aristotle. First-hand, I have only studied his work on logic, definitions and the part of his work called "Categories". Whenever I refer to other philosophies or thinkers, know that my knowledge of them is not based on first-hand study but either lectures or reading of summaries or second-hand references. I aim to expand my knowledge of other philosophers and thinkers eventually, but for now, such is the case.
