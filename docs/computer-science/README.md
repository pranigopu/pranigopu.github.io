# Computer Science
## Introduction
Computer science is the science of automating cognitive tasks, e.g. procedures, data processing, memory management, user interface and more (as a side note, artificial intelligence can be thought of as a sister field, i.e. a field that is driven by computer science but also draws from mathematics, statistics and cognitive science). My writings, learnings and programming references on certain topics in computer science.
