# Annotation
An annotation of a unit of data (e.g. a data point, a resource, etc.) is an explicit labelling of the nature and/or function of the data with respect to some target or purpose.

# Conceptual model
A conceptual model is a sufficiently abstract and useful representation of an entity or system. Here, "abstract" means only relevant details are held and irrelevant details are omitted. Note that "relevance" and "sufficiency" is with respect to the given context and purpose. Hence, _a conceptual model is a useful essentialisation of an entity or a system_. A learning model is a conceptual model for which one or more parameters are to be optimised according to observed data.
