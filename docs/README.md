# Personal Writing and Art Collection
## Introduction
I am Prani Gopu, a.k.a. Pranav Gopalkrishna. I enjoy writing works of various kinds, including stories, articles and poems. This website contains a comprehensive collection of my works. Note that this website also contains the works of others (e.g. quotes, passages, poems, artworks, etc.) that I wanted to collect in one place â€“ of course, I shall give due credit and not infringe on any copyright. For convenience, I have divided the content of this website into categories on multiple levels. Lastly, for a more visually appealing showcase of some of my writing, I have created [another website](https://pranigopu.wordpress.com/) using WordPress (which I find easier to make pretty, and where commenting is possible).
