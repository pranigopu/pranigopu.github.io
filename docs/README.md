# Welcome to Prani's Corner of the Interweb
## Introduction
I am Prani Gopu, a.k.a. Pranav Gopalkrishna. I am avid programmer, reader and writer, having done a number of projects (research-based and/or application-based) and writings, which range from fiction to poetry to technical essays. Apart from this, I have also composed music (and may do so again in the future), and I occasionally post videos (videos about anything I like, touching areas such as music, Minecraft timelapses, project presentations and essays read aloud).

This website contains a comprehensive collection of my links and writings. Note that this website also contains the works of others (e.g. quotes, passages, poems, artworks, etc.) that I wanted to collect in one place â€“ of course, I shall give due credit and not infringe on any copyright. For convenience, I have divided the content of this website into categories on multiple levels. Lastly, for a more visually appealing showcase of some of my writing, I have created [another website](https://pranigopu.wordpress.com/) using WordPress (which I find easier to make pretty, and where commenting is possible).
