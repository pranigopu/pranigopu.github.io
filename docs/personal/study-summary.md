# Summary of AI
AI is the study of the automation of cognition and decision-making. It is an area within CS because it deals with computation, information and automation. Hence, AI extends CS to higher-level cognition and/or decision-making, and CS is the practical basis for AI. ML and SeM are the areas within AI that concern with automating cognition; ML is the study of automating a system's use of observations to improve its ability to deal with a given task, whereas SeM is the study of automating the exploration of a solution space. ML and SeM can be the basis for a decision-making system, but on their own, they are concerned more with cognitive tasks, e.g. classification, prediction, planning, etc. IA is the area within AI that concerns with automating decision-making. It may use ML and SeM, but it extends to other methods that combine perception of some form with decision-making of some form (e.g. behaviour trees, steering, etc.). PCG is the area within AI that concerns with automating content creation, which involves decision-making and possibly cognition. PCG based only on decision-making relies on algorithms and possibly random number generation (RNG), e.g. cellular automata, grammars, gradient noise, etc. PCG based on SeM and ML relies on learning from examples, feedback and/or the optimisation some metric by which solutions can be measured, e.g. generative adversarial networks (GANs), neural style transfer (NST), etc.
