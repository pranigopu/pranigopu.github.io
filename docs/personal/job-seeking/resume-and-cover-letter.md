## 1. Resume is always read by HR
### Higher competition due to job portals
Online job portals makes applying for jobs easier across a wider geographical areas, which means good/viable jobs have much higher competition. Hence, it is often infeasible and unnecessary for the HR to go through all the applications.

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System)
The aim of ATS is to block ~90% of the resumes, i.e. they seek to filter the top 10% resumes. Why? Because the job of ATS is to make the HR's job easier. Hence, the goal of an applicant is to understand what the ATS is looking for; however, you cannot fine-tune, since different ATSs are configured differently, and only th HRs know the exact configuration.
