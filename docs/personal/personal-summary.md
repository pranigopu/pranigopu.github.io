# Introduction
My central purpose is the exploration, expansion and elucidation of valuable ideas; such ideas may come from statistics, machine learning, philosophy, etc., but my orientation in the long-run is toward making the value of these ideas accessible to myself and others. In terms of my career, my area of focus is machine learning (ML), which draws from my master’s in AI and from my undergraduate studies in computer science, mathematics and statistics.

# Why AI and ML?
AI in general is the science of automating cognition, and ML in particular is the science of automating a system’s use of data to improve its ability to deal with a given task. The overabundance of data in today’s world offers an immense potential for learning, if the data can be harnessed. To this end, my background in statistics provides the theoretical foundations for analysing and interpreting data, while my background in ML provides the link between theory and the practical application of models that analyse and interpret data. I have substantial experience in computer science — especially in programming — for both academic and personal projects, which provides me the tools necessary to realise conceptual solutions, such as statistical and ML solutions.

# Background study and projects
Tying my background of statistics, ML and computer science to my central purpose, my productive purpose is to explore, expand and elucidate concepts, frameworks and solutions in ML and data science. To this end, I aim in the long-run to engage in research for ML solutions in key problem areas of data-driven AI, such as explainability, transparency, accountability and data security. In the short-to-medium-term, my aim is to gain practical experience in related areas (e.g. in data-driven business decision-making, industrial research, etc.) so as to strengthen my grasp of the use and value of ML solutions.

Aligning with my aforementioned aims are my academic and personal projects that I have undertaken in the course of my bachelor’s and master’s. My most notable projects are listed below:

Evaluating uncertainty quantification of Bayesian neural networks: This study aims to evaluate the uncertainty quantification of Bayesian neural network models (BNN models) about their own predictions, focusing on comparing two Bayesian inference (BI) methods — Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) — that are based on two broad approaches to computational BI, namely exact and approximate BI. This study draws on a number of papers exploring computational BI methods and their application in deep learning, i.e. for neural networks. This study serves to expand my skills in research and technical presentation.

Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Music (Python): The objective was to implement a ML system to recognise musical keys and tempo of a given piece of music. CNN was applied for musical key recognition and BRNN for tempo recognition. The training audio data used was pre-processed using a custom pipeline that converted audio signals to Mel spectrograms using Librosa and then converted each Mel spectrogram into equally sized segments. The tasks were combined using an end-to-end post-processing system to generate predictions. This project serves to expand my hands-on experience in recognising appropriate ML architectures for the given tasks, implementing these architectures (using Python), and performing data pre-processing and the post-processing of results.
