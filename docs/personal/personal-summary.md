# Introduction
AI is the science of automating cognition, and just as cognition lies at the intersection between the physical and mental worlds, AI lies at the intersection between the physical and digital worlds. Like cognition, AI is about using data to act to achieve a practical purpose, especially long-range. AI, i.e. automated cognition, if done right, can allow for faster, more accurate and more powerful processing of data, and in today's data-rich world, AI has more potential than perhaps any other technology to expand our problem-solving capabilities.

The practical value of AI is realised in the intersection between the physical and digital worlds. However, AI is a complex field, with complexity in both the conceptualisation of solutions and their implementation, i.e. in both theory and practice. My central purpose is to explore, expand, and communicate ideas that lie at this intersection, in order to realise the practical value of AI in a variety of use-cases, such as the recognition of cybersecurity threats, medical diagnosis, customer care, etc. These ideas may originate from fields such as statistics, computer science and symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms, but regardless of their source, the core objective is always to make their value accessible to AI practitioners.

# Background
My background in statistics provides a strong theoretical foundation for analysing data, while my expertise in ML connects this theory with practical applications. In addition, my programming experience, gained through both academic and personal projects, equips me with the skills necessary to implement advanced statistical and ML solutions. I am particularly drawn to MUDS's focus on interdisciplinary research, especially at the intersection of data science and areas such as life sciences, health, natural sciences, and robotics, as this approach aligns with my passion for applying data-driven solutions to complex, real-world problems. The opportunity to engage with a diverse range of topics at MUDS — from data analytics and high-performance computing to uncertainty quantification — fits perfectly with my research interests. My master’s thesis on uncertainty quantification has already given me a glimpse into these complex data challenges, and I am eager to explore them further.

# Background study and projects
Tying my background of statistics, ML and computer science to my central purpose, my productive purpose is to explore, expand and elucidate concepts, frameworks and solutions in ML and data science. To this end, I aim in the long-run to engage in research for ML solutions in key problem areas of data-driven AI, such as explainability, transparency, accountability and data security. In the short-to-medium-term, my aim is to gain practical experience in related areas (e.g. in data-driven business decision-making, industrial research, etc.) so as to strengthen my grasp of the use and value of ML solutions. Aligning with my aforementioned aims are my academic and personal projects that I have undertaken in the course of my bachelor’s and master’s. My most notable projects are listed below:

**Evaluating uncertainty quantification of Bayesian neural networks**: This study aims to evaluate the uncertainty quantification of Bayesian neural network models (BNN models) about their own predictions, focusing on comparing two Bayesian inference (BI) methods — Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) — that are based on two broad approaches to computational BI, namely exact and approximate BI. This study draws on a number of papers exploring computational BI methods and their application in deep learning, i.e. for neural networks. This study serves to expand my skills in research and technical presentation.

**Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Music (Python)**: The objective was to implement a ML system to recognise musical keys and tempo of a given piece of music. CNN was applied for musical key recognition and BRNN for tempo recognition. The training audio data used was pre-processed using a custom pipeline that converted audio signals to Mel spectrograms using Librosa and then converted each Mel spectrogram into equally sized segments. The tasks were combined using an end-to-end post-processing system to generate predictions. This project serves to expand my hands-on experience in recognising appropriate ML architectures for the given tasks, implementing these architectures (using Python), and performing data pre-processing and the post-processing of results.
