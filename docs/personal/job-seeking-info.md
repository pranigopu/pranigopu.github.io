**JOB-SEEKING INFO**

---

- Searching for a job in the corporate sector
- Technical or managerial

---

Online job search: Highly inefficient and ineffective due to high competition and low success rate; keep applying, but no more than 20% of the time.

Networking is:

- Identifying the right people to network with
- Leading with value
- Focus on "what is in it for me?" (WIIFM)
    - From my perspective and from the other person's

Blue ocean strategy

- Red ocean: Intense competition, limited potential customers
- Blue ocean: No competition, vast range of potential customers

The C.A.R. framework

- Companies: Target companies that are going to hire in the near future but not yet; how to measure this? By the below metrics:
    - Fastest growing companies
    - Best places to work (why; because such companies always pay more than the marketplace and help you thrive)
    - Companies entering India

- Alumni: People do business with people they know, like and trust; hence, alumni are among the best people to target
    - Always start with asking for advice


- Recruiters: Recruiters are of two types: internal and external. Here, we are talking about internal recruiters, i.e. recruiters within the target company/organisation

Do not connect asking for a job. Why? When you ask someone for a job and you do not know this person, you are taking a debit from a relationship where you do not yet have any credit.

Rephrase: How can I contribute to the growth opportunities in your company? Switch from "job seeker" to "problem solver". Companies hire problem solvers, i.e. people who can help them profit, not job seekers.

Targeted list of at least 25 companies, with a targeted list of 10-20 alumni each, plus a targeted list of around 5 recruiters each. This is more than 370 leads for a job search! This is a blue ocean strategy with respect to the job market.

**NOTE**: Hiring is a P2P (person-to-person) business.
