# Natural Sciences
## Introduction
Natural sciences consist of the sciences that deal with physical entities and their interactions. Physics deals with energy and matter, chemistry deals with changes in substances due to interactions between substances, biology deals with living organisms, etc. Every natural science has its unique axioms and scope, but since the reality is an integrated whole, the natural sciences complement or supplement each other. My purpose in studying the natural sciences is to concretise the nature of the world around me, i.e. to see how the law of identity and the principle of causality actually play out.
