## Introduction
Natural sciences consist of the sciences that deal with physical entities and their interactions. Physics deals with energy and matter, chemistry deals with changes in substances due to interactions between substances, biology deals with living organisms, etc. Every natural science has its unique axioms and scope, but since the reality is an integrated whole, the natural sciences complement or supplement each other.
