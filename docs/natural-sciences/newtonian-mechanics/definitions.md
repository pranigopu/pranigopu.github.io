# Quantity of matter
This is the measure of the matter of a body, arising from both the volume taken up by the body and the density of the body. Thus, doubling the volume and doubling the density together quadruple the quantity of matter. From this measure, we omit any medium present in the spaces between the parts of the body, e.g. air within a sponge. Furthermore, weight is proportional to matter, as can be seen in experiments on pendulums (shown later).

# Quantity of motion
This is the measure of the motion (i.e. change in position) of a body, arising from both the velocity of the body and the quantity of the body's matter. In other words, the motion of a body is the sum of the motion of the parts of the body. Thus, doubling the velocity and doubling the quantity of matter together quadruple to quantity of motion.

# Inertia
Also called:

- Vis insita
- Innate force of matter
- Vis inertiae

Note that a body, given the inactivity of its matter (i.e. lack of motive force from the matter), is not put out of its state of rest of motion without some effort; hence the body's matter exerts some force against any force impressed upon it. _However, note that the body's matter exerts its force only when another force is impressed upon it_, i.e. the body's matter as such is inactive when it is not acted upon. This innate force, i.e. inertia, has two aspects:

1. <details><summary>Resistance</summary><p>This refers to the aspect of inertia that withstands the force impressed so as to maintain the body's present state.</p></details>
2. <details><summary>Impulse</summary><p>This refers to the aspect of inertia that, by withstanding the force impressed, acts to change the state of the body that is impressing the force.</p></details>

A body that offers resistance also exerts an impulse, a reactive impulse amounts to resistance. Hence, these aspects of inertia are aspects of the same basic force, i.e. the innate force of a body's matter. Also note that resistance and impulse both apply to a body whether it is at rest or in motion, because rest and motion (as usually understood) are relative, and not all bodies taken to be at rest from one point of reference are necessarily so with respect to another point of reference.

# Impressed force
This is an action exerted upon a body so as to change its state (which may be a state of rest or uniform motion). This force is an aspect of action alone, and is no longer in the body once the action is over, because a body sustains its new states by inertia alone. Impressed forces can be from various sources: percussion, pressure, centripetal force.

# Centripetal force
This is a force by which bodies in any way tend toward a point, which is the centre of the force. Examples of such a force: earth's gravity, magnetism, the force that draws back a stone whirled in a sling, the force that causes celestial bodies deviate from a rectilinear path and into a curvilinear path around a centre, etc.

**Excerpt linking earth's gravity to orbital movement**:

_A projectile, if it was not for the force of gravity, would not deviate towards the earth, but would go off from it in a right line, and that with an uniform motion, if the resistance of the air was taken away. It is by its gravity that it is drawn aside perpetually from its rectilinear course, and made to deviate towards the earth, more or less, according to the force of its gravity, and the velocity of its motion. The less its gravity is, for the quantity of its matter, or the greater the velocity with which it is projected, the less will it deviate from a rectilinear course, and the farther it will go. If a leaden ball, projected from the top of a mountain by the force of gunpowder with a given velocity, and in a direction parallel to the horizon, is carried in a curve line to the distance of two miles before it falls to the ground; the same, if the resistance of the air were taken away, with a double or decuple velocity, would fly twice or ten times as far. And by increasing the velocity, we may at pleasure increase the distance to which it might be projected, and diminish the curvature of the line, which it might describe, till at last it should fall at the distance of 10, 30, or 90 degrees, or even might go quite round the whole earth before it falls; or lastly, so that it might never fall to the earth, but go forward into the celestial spaces, and proceed in its motion in infinitum._

Hence, by identifying gravity as a centripetal force, and identifying that the curvature in a body's line of motion due to any centripetal force decreases as the body's velocity increases, Newton reveals the link between the forces making objects fall to the ground and forces making making celestial bodies go around in orbits.

Now, centripetal force can be quantified in three ways...

- Absolute quantity of centripetal force
- Accelerative quantity of centripetal force
- Motive quantity of centripetal force

## Absolute quantity of centripetal force
This is a measure of centripetal force proportional to the range and intensity of the force as propagated from the centre. In other words, it is a measure proportional to the efficacy of the cause of the centripetal force (that propagates it from the centre) through the spaces around the centre.

## Accelerative quantity of centripetal force
This is a measure of centripetal force proportional to the _velocity_ it adds to body in a given time. For example, upto some distance from the earth's centre, the earth adds the velocity of approximately 9.8 m/s to any body. Note that that velocity is not the same thing as motion; velocity is the measure of how much distance in a given direction is covered in a given time, whereas motion combines mass and velocity, i.e. motion refers to momentum. We see this distinction become clear in the distinction between the accelerative and motive quantity of centripetal force.

## Motive quantity of centripetal force
This is a measure of centripetal force proportional to the _motion_ it adds to body in a given time. Hence, this is the measure of centripency, i.e. the tendency of the whole body toward the centre, which is in fact the body's _weight_. Hence, the motive quantity of centripetal force is the weight of the body on which the force is being impressed. Note that a body's weight is always know by the quantity of an equal and opposite force that is just enough to stop the descent of the body; for example, the innate force of the ground offers an equal and opposite force that is just enough to stop descent further toward the earth's centre, and a weighing machine can measure this force.

## Conclusion
For brevity, we can call these quantities of centripetal force as absolute, accelerative and motive forces. Their distinction is as follows: absolute force is with respect to the centre of force toward which bodies tend, accelerative force is with respect to the places of the bodies, and motive force is with respect to the bodies themselves, i.e. the momentum they gain as they tend toward the centre. In Newton's own words, here is the distinction between motive and accelerative force:

_I refer the motive force to the body as an endeavour and propensity of the whole towards a centre, arising from the propensities of the several parts taken together; the accelerative force to the place of the body, as a certain power or energy diffused from the centre to all places around to move the bodies that are in them; and the absolute force to the centre, as endued with some cause, without which those motive forces would not be propagated through the spaces round about; whether that cause be some central body (such as is the load-stone, in the centre of the magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the gravitating force), or anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design only to give a mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their physical causes and seats._

To continue:

_Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter; and the motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter. For the sum of the actions of the accelerative force, upon the several articles of the body, is the motive force of the whole._

**NOTE**: _Celerity means velocity._
