- My mis-
- -takes shall not shame me, for
- They are steps to the light — the
- Truth, the source of my strength, its pur-
- -suit, the source of my pride. I <br><br>
- Relish not in my rightness, but in my
- Hunger for that which is right;
- When my acts nourish me, I’ll know
- Then it’s on my side.
