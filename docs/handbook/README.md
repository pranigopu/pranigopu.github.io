[**Truth and Pride**](https://pranigopu.github.io/art/poetry/poems-for-life-on-earth.html)

My mis- <br>
-takes shall not shame me, for <br>
They are steps to the light — the <br>
Truth, the source of my strength, its pur- <br>
-suit, the source of my pride. I

Relish not in my rightness, but in my <br>
Hunger for that which is right; <br>
When my acts nourish me, I’ll know <br>
Then it’s on my side.

[**Quotations**](https://pranigopu.github.io/quotations.html)

Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed, for existence is identity, consciousness is identification. Thus, reason, even if erring, is one's tie to reality, and thus, the most virtuous of virtues. Thus, by reason shall I live, and by reason, I see that death does not concern the living for they are alive. Alive as I am, I see that in life, there is much to wish for and much to want. Now, God said, "Take what you want and pay for it," and I wish to live my life in reality and not pay with my life for the unreal. Thus, I wish only for what is and can be, and as I strive for what can be, I must keep in mind that self-esteem is earned, but pride is practiced. Living in this world with pride in my purpose, the purpose of purposes being my very life in its every moment, I look around and see that numberless are the world's wonders, but none more wonderful than man.
