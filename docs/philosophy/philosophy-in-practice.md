# Laying the foundations
The right internal effects need the right internal causes. Thus, to be motivated, you need to believe, i.e. internalise the right views, values and virtues, and to internalise them, you need to be convinced of them — for a rational person, to convince is to convince with truth and reason (evasion and irrationality destroy your capacity to think and act effectively, and thus, are not a valid alternatives to truth and reason). Intention and will are not omnipotent and do not circumvent the need for the right causes of motivation.

## The role of philosophy
Philosophy is the basis of the way in which you deal with reality, either implicitly or explicitly. To make it explicit is to bring it into conscious focus, thus bringing it into conscious action. While this is always important, this is especially important if your initial internalised (implicit) philosophy is poor. In learning or relearning the right philosophy explicitly, you reinforce and internalise — or begin to internalise — the basis of the way to deal with reality that is rational, self-motivated and happiness-oriented.

## Absolute conviction
Consciousness needs an apparatus to be effective; this apparatus includes the subconscious. The subconscious, to some degree, automates the process of perceiving that which exists and acting on its perception with respect to context (cognitive, moral and situational). Such automation is vital due to: (1) time and energy constraints (automation helps handle them most efficiently with respect to time and energy) and (2) constraints of focus (automation frees the focus for more conscious units).


**NOTE**: _Automation is more time and energy efficient than deliberation, but of course, deliberation has its own vital place in cognition and action. Time and energy efficiency does not mean efficiency as a whole, i.e. it does not necessarily mean keeping a low cost while maintaining the required effectiveness. To achieve efficiency as a whole (i.e. effectiveness with low cost) often requires deliberation too._


The vital role of the subconscious in one’s life means that the core values and principles one validates through reason must be internalised, i.e. made a part of the subconscious. Internalisation is, in essence, the unquestioned acceptance (within some context) of the validity of an idea (e.g. a value or principle). To question it is to bring it into conscious focus; this is vital in its own way, but is not rational (i.e. not practical, and often not even possible) to do in every case.

## Integrating the fundamentals with the expansion
_I am talking about philosophy, but it also applies generally in all fields of study._

The fundamentals of ideas as such serve to form a solid, reliable basis for your further learning that strengthens your ideas, convictions and actions in narrower contexts. However, the fundamentals by themselves — being very abstract — cannot inform you about more concrete cases, situations and issues. Hence, you need an expansion of your fundamentals into more concrete or specific contexts to understand their application. Note that this is not primarily a deductive process; you do not start with the fundamentals and merely deduce how to apply them. No, it is more of an inductive process (though, of course, applying logic in general will involve both induction and deduction), wherein you integrate your experiences as well as specific lessons and ideas either to the fundamentals or using the fundamentals, thereby forming new knowledge informing you about how to deal with more concrete or specific contexts. On the flip side, just focusing on the expansion, i.e. the concretes and the specifics can deprive you of the means to integrate or validate your conclusions and ground them in firm, retainable convictions that relate to other convictions. Such deprivation diminishes your overall capacity to act (since you would be swamped by particulars with no way to organise or integrate them).

Hence, you need to focus on both as required: the fundamentals and the expansion.

---

**Observations**:

_More specific principles are not enough_...

When first trying to concretise or apply my fundamentals (specifically in ethics), I tried to expand on the broader principles and obtain more specific principles that I could use (you can see these principles here: Principles for Life). While helpful and a good step forward, such principles are still too broad to depend on entirely. I realised that I needed more than more specific abstract principles. I needed experience and the integration of experience into learning, methods, approaches, perspectives, etc. All that (and maybe more) is necessary in order to successfully apply my basic philosophy in life. Broader abstractions and abstract principles are necessary, but they are not sufficient.

_Including informative failures and pitfalls that you experienced_...

When trying to discover the effective ways of applying my philosophy, I often ran into pitfalls, mistakes or flaws in my approach or thinking that led to certain failures or poor results. However, these failures and poor results served as important data to help point me in the right direction. Now, while documenting the right direction that I had learned, it was very beneficial to include where and why I had failed before; not only would it help me or others out of similar situations in the future, it could also serve to strengthen and validate the inductive process that led to the right conclusions.

**NOTE**: _The last observation above extends to the value of including concrete observations in general (successes, failures, attempts and others)._

# Integrating the actual and the potential
## Acceptance of reality
The acceptance of reality, i.e. the conscious affirmation of the facts of reality is the basis for rationality and thus for morality. Never place an "I wish" over an "it is", since doing so is means turning away from the real in favour of the unreal, i.e. that which you neither have nor seek knowledge about. Accept reality for all that it is so you can effectively strive toward what can be, i.e. the pursuit of value presupposes the acknowledgement of truth.

## The basis of motivation and willpower
**LEXICAL NOTE**:

Motivation is the concrete experience of the value for a particular potential. Willpower is the self-driven capacity of the volitional faculty to exert effort in a particular direction of focus. Willpower and motivation are ultimately integrated in one's pursuit of value; willpower is the volitional effort to engage in a pursuit, motivation is the fuel that makes such engagement possible, especially long-range.

---

Motivation is based on life-affirmation in the moment and the focus on the facts. The focus on the facts is an essential form of life-affirmation, since it affirms the basis of one's pursuit of life, namely the affirmation of reality. What does really mean in practice? In practice, look at reality, look at your motives, keep the factual context in mind and then following your motives to the fullest. In other words, do not divorce your motivation from the pursuit of values, but instead of trying to force your motivation through sheer willpower, acknowledge and accept your motives while staying in full focus of reality, i.e. of your relevant factual context. Most importantly, do not divorce the affirmation of life in the moment from the pursuit of efficacy, especially long-range. Why does it work?

The philosophical basis is clear: life is the standard of value and the ultimate value, which means it is what integrates every other value. In essence, every value is but one value, i.e. the value for one's life, applied in different ways to different contexts (see: ["Integrity of values" from _The Nature of Value_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html#integrity-of-values)). However, since concretes are the metaphysical source of any truth and thus any value, the metaphysical source of the value for life (i.e. the source as present in reality) is necessarily the concrete affirmation of one's life, i.e. the self-motivated engagement with reality in the here and now (ranging from pleasure, enjoyment, etc. to focus, such as attentive focus, productive focus, etc. to recreation, relaxation, etc. to pain, serenity, struggle, etc.). Without such affirmation, no value exists and hence no motivation can be sustained.

Consider it another way: why pursue something, short-term or long-term, if there is no purpose to it? If you gain nothing from life as you live it and thereby nothing fuels or sustains you for striving toward your life's potential, then how can you strive for any potential? Furthermore, why strive toward anything if not ultimately to affirm life in the moment? If life is not affirmed in the here and now in some form, the value for it becomes a floating abstraction and thereby loses its tie to reality. Life is the source of purpose and thereby of value, so if no affirmation of life is pursued and achieved in some form, then ultimately (1) nothing is purposeful and (2) motivation dies out.

However, why follow your motivations to the fullest while keeping one's focus on reality rather than fight against motivations toward more "constructive" or long-range pursuits? Note that by "fighting" one's motivations, I do not mean engaging in uncomfortable, difficult or even excruciating work — after all, motivation can persist even in great hardship and falter even in great comfort, so "comfort" and "pleasantness" are non-essentials in motivation (not necessarily insignificant but non-essential). Rather, by "fighting" one's motivations, I mean acting against your motives, i.e. acting against what you experience most concrete value for (e.g. emotionally, psychologically, physically, etc.). Now, consider the following points:

1.

The source of volition and therefore of willpower is one's ability to direct one's focus. Hence, ultimately, keeping one's focus on reality (which includes the factual context, one's philosophical convictions, one's hierarchy of values in a broader level, etc.) is the basic cause for the direction of one's motivation.

2.

One's volitional mechanism is finite in capacity and has a particular nature and range by which it operates; trying to operate one’s volition apart from its nature or outside its range leads to motivational overload, i.e. the failure to concretely value something. When in such a state, trying to push past it by mere effort is the denial of the nature of your volitional faculty and thereby a denial of reality. To put it in other words, willpower is finite (though renewable) and not omnipotent even within one's own mind, and motivation is neither causeless nor subjective but rather based on one's internalised premises.

3.

Drawing from the second point, one's volitional mechanism can only operate when one's potential is concretised in some way and to some extent. This is because the basis of volition is long-range purpose, and the metaphysical basis of purpose is the concrete affirmation of life. To concretise potential is to concretise the values present in the pursuit of the potential; if such values do not exist, the pursuit cannot be sustained after a point.

---

Combining the above three points, we observe that fighting against one's motivations can at most be a short-range effort and cannot sustain long-range. Furthermore, relying only on one's sheer willpower to fight against "undesirable motivations" ignores the source of willpower itself, i.e. one's self-directed focus on reality and the conscious affirmation of the facts one grasps. Furthermore, it ignores the source of motivation, namely the concrete affirmation of life, i.e. the concrete experience of values, which is the metaphysical source of all values. Lastly, it is key to grasp that motivation, i.e. the concrete experience of one's value for a potential is key to the operation of one's volitional mechanism; without such concrete experience, the value for the potential remains a floating abstraction, losing its ties to reality.

Summarising the point so far into a tip, the idea is: keep your focus on reality, do not practice self-abnegation but rather engage with your motivations with full awareness and full intent, check your core premises and ultimately let your premises and your focus on reality shape your motivations and thereby fuel and sustain your capacity to pursue a certain potential (be it short-range or long-range). Note that motivation does not take away from the necessity of willpower, since motivation is the fuel and not the driver of willpower.

---

**NOTE 1**: You can exert your willpower against your motivations, but only upto a point. Some short-term cases may occasionally call for such a use of willpower (e.g. emergencies or short deadlines), but note that it is not sustainable to do so and, if done as a practice, will lead you to become drained and unable to apply your willpower any further and potentially even unable to experience the value for life for a while.

**NOTE 2**: The nature of motivational overload is further discussed in the section ["Motivational overload" from "Overload" from "Sources of inefficacy"](#motivational-overload).

---

**Observations**:

1.

In the face of a deadline that was not too close but important to address (i.e. my semester 2 final assignments in 2024), I found that consciously and completely engaging with concretely enjoyable activities — such as watching a show I enjoyed — had two advantages compared to pushing against my desires and forcing myself to work. (1) I did not drain my willpower, and thus, did not drain my motivation and capacity to engage with valuable but uncomfortable work in general. (2) I was able to properly satisfy myself (since I did not keep undermining my pleasure with shame or despair) and move past my need for concrete enjoyment, and thus, was able to focus on more challenging work more effectively, leading to far more efficient work and substantial results. I would compare this case to that of starvation; when you are starved, it is hard to think of anything but food, not least because food is an essential need that must be satisfied to fuel yourself for other pursuits. In this light, note that I do not regard concrete enjoyment — or any form of life-affirmation — as something “to get over with” or a nuisance or an itch that must be addressed, but rather, as a vital, genuine need of my mind and for my life, just as food is a genuine need of the body and not a mere indulgence.

**KEY POINT**: _The above only applies if there is no evasion on your part about what you are doing and what may be its consequences to you. Only a full and true acceptance of reality as it is can ensure that such indulgence can be of any value and pleasure (in the true sense) to you; evasion is a cause of shame and despair, and thus, destroys enjoyment and life-affirmation._

2.

When I strain myself beyond my motivations, I tend to get drained in one or more respects; cognitively, emotionally or physically. Cognitive and physical drain are easier to overcome through rest, but emotional drain indicates a psychological experience of loss in values. Even if such a loss is worth the values involved, since the psychological aspect of motivation is what drives you, such a loss in fact drains you (at least temporarily) of the will to pursue your goals further (a good analogy would be the training of muscles). The psychological aspect can be shaped over time but often not immediately, and draining it in the short-run makes losing the context of and thus value for the long-run almost inevitable (e.g. (a) initial and intermediate stages of doing the final assignments of semester 2 in 2024, (b) December-January examination preparation in 2023-2024, wherein I lost the motivation for both job applications and studying, etc.).

## Further points on motivation

1.

Motivation has both an intellectual (abstract) and a psychological (concrete) aspect. Both are vital and must be integrated (at least over time); the abstract aspect integrates the relevant concretes and validates motivations in the right context, whereas the concrete aspect is what ultimately drives your actions. However, the concrete, i.e. psychological aspect is largely subconscious; the abstract, i.e. intellectual aspect is key in shaping the psychological aspect, but such shaping must be done logically (remember the analogy of a programmer — the intellectual aspect — and the computer — the psychological aspect). Thus, shaping your motivations may often be a matter of a more tactful, indirect approach rather than direct intent or willpower, especially in view of the complexity of your goals and of your means to achieve them.

2.

If you lack the motivation or capacity to do something in a given context, then beyond a certain point, you literally — in fact — cannot sustain its pursuit of your own volition in that context. However, this need not incapacitate you; while you may lack the motivation or capacity to do something in the given context, you can shift your focus to improve your ability (e.g. by addressing more basic existential needs, mental or physical) or pursue something else (according to what you judge to be the most important or valuable in a broader context). Note that motivation can persevere in the hardest, most severe of conditions, and it can falter even in relative comfort; in general, it is not primarily a question of “what is going on outside” but “what is going on inside” (although, of course, both questions are important and potentially relevant to each other). Why is the motivation present or absent? Ask to understand its roots: what are its essential causes, what are the relevant factors in dealing with it, etc.? Understanding this is a part of understanding reality objectively so you can deal with it effectively. It is ineffective to try to brute-force your way through your lack of motivation because the facts about your consciousness (e.g. the nature of volition, finiteness of willpower, etc.) and its relationship to reality (e.g. how emotions and motives arise, what is the nature and role of values, how can and must a mind grasp the facts effectively, etc.) will not sustain it.

## Hierarchical and contextual organisation of values
To make explicit what has been implicit so far: values, same as knowledge, are hierarchical and contextual. Hence, values, same as knowledge, must be evaluated from the most fundamental, abstract level to the most concrete level. Whether you start with abstract or concrete considerations, make sure to integrate to the point that you gain the most fundamental, abstract level view of the goal before applying this view to the more concrete levels; this allows you to pursue your values in a broader context, the broadest being of your life as a whole.

# Decision-making
## Rational decision-making is never automatic
With the right principles, methods and practice, rational decision-making can be greatly facilitated and become second nature, but it can never be automatic, no matter how much and how well you integrate your premises, your knowledge, your thoughts, your motives and your actions. Why? Because even after integrating, the fact remains that no non-self-evident knowledge is automatic. Note also that instinct and intuition, while invaluable, are also not automatically valid, especially not by default; you still need to validate whether they are applicable in the given context. Furthermore, the facts remains that (1) focus is still finite and (2) the right adherence to the facts and the right application of one's mental contents with respect to the given context are still not automatic, since they still require you to bring to focus the facts and the right parts of your mental contents with respect to the facts. Finally, the effort to apply one's knowledge through action also requires a conscious decision, since the application itself is not automatic and does not lead to an automatic action. Hence, while decision-making can get smoother and more efficient, it is never wholly automatic and certainly not automatic by default and in the long-range.

**NOTE**: _You can automate parts of decision-making as appropriate, but to know whether it is appropriate to do so also requires deliberate focus._

# Sources of inefficacy
## Evasion
Evasion is the mind-killer, since it is an implicit or explicit but unequivocal rejection of reality in some form. Given that reality is interconnected, and given that evasion blinds you to your knowledge of reality, evasion degrades and ultimately destroys your mental efficacy and — by extension — your efficacy in life and the pursuit of values. Evasion makes reality your antagonist, and once reality is your antagonist, you can only lose. Hence, a key necessity in achieving and maintaining efficacy in life is self-honesty in every sense: truth, values and the responsibilities that arise from the pursuit of values (note that values are a form of truth; the distinction is for clarity). An analogy for evasive living is choosing to drive while drunk; you may turn out fine in the end, but (1) it is still reckless, irresponsible and immoral, and (2) it ruins your capacity to achieve more or achieve what you can to the fullest in your life.

## Overload
Overload as such refers to the event wherein one’s attempts exceed one’s capacity. The capacity in question may be cognitive, psychological, physical, etc. I shall now expand on key forms of mental overload that can degrade or destroy one's capacity to be rational in a given context.

### Cognitive overload
The mind has an identity, and can only function according to that identity; trying to operate one’s mind outside its range leads to cognitive failure. If you want to use your mind properly, i.e. to use it rationally and be rational, you must use it according to its capacity and capability. This means saying no to mental overload whenever you recognise it; when overloaded, it is always possible and practical to reduce the load. There are many ways to achieve this, such as: (1) shifting your goals appropriately, (2) resting your mind, (3) offloading ideas onto paper (e.g. listing possible solutions, elucidating the aspects of the problem, etc.), (4) shifting your perspective (e.g. thinking in broader terms or abstractions, concretising the problem (i.e. thinking in specifics), etc.).


**NOTE**: _For point (4), what you do depends on what is established in your mind already. If you have established a rational framework of abstractions, then dealing with particulars is easier using the broader framework where applicable. If not, you only have floating abstractions and instead must build up from concretes or specifics._


_How is cognitive overload recognised?_

Cognitive overload happens when you are unable to focus on the essentials. If you find that whenever you shift your focus mentally, you are inevitably losing sight of the essentials (e.g. the purpose, the key facts, the relevant context, etc.), then you can know that you are experiencing cognitive overload. Remember that the ability to focus varies with the context: a high-pressure situation tends to narrow one’s focus to the barest level, whereas a relaxed situation may allow a broader scope than even normal circumstances.

### Motivational overload
_This is an extension of_ ["Rational application of volition" from _Rationality in Practice_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/rationality-in-practice.html#rational-application-of-volition).

This follows from the same basic premise as cognitive overload: the mind — and thus, one’s volitional mechanism — has an identity, and can only function according to that identity; trying to operate one’s volition outside its range leads to motivational failure, i.e. the failure to concretely (i.e. through action) value something.

_Lacking motivation or capacity in general_...

When you lack the motivation or capacity to do X in a given context, you literally — in fact — cannot do it of your own volition in that context. However, this need not incapacitate you; while you may lack the motivation or capacity to do X in the given context, you can shift your focus to improve your ability (e.g. by addressing more basic existential needs, mental or physical) or pursue something else (according to what you judge to be the most important or valuable in a broader context). Note that motivation can persevere in the hardest, most severe of conditions, and it can falter even in relative comfort; in general, it is not primarily a question of “what is going on outside” but “what is going on inside” (although, of course, both questions are important and potentially relevant to each other). Why is the motivation present or absent? Ask to understand its roots: what are its essential causes, what are the relevant factors in dealing with it, etc.? Understanding this is a part of understanding reality objectively so you can deal with it effectively. It is ineffective to try to brute-force your way through your lack of motivation because the facts about your consciousness (e.g. the nature of volition, finiteness of willpower, etc.) and its relationship to reality (e.g. how emotions and motives arise, what is the nature and role of values, how can and must a mind grasp the facts effectively, etc.) will not sustain it.

_Motivational overload in particular_...

Motivational overload in particular refers to the case wherein there is a lack of motivation or capacity to do X (either as such or beyond a certain point or extent) without any relevant deficiency (i.e. there may be a deficiency that needs to be addressed in a broader or separate context, but not in the current one). This is why the term “overload” is used: you are pushing yourself beyond the proper, rational range of your capacity within the given context in some respect. Note again that here, I take the case to be such one wherein it may be possible to improve your capacity in a broader context but is practically impossible and/or unnecessary to do so in the current one.

_How to recognise motivational overload?_

When you experience no concrete value in a pursuit you are trying to act toward, you are motivationally overloaded with respect to that pursuit. Note that this is not the same as “not feeling like doing something”, at least not in the usual sense of the phrase (the usual sense being something akin to “it is unpleasant”, “it is painful”, etc.). Remember, you can be very motivated to do something hard or painful. Hence, by “experiencing no concrete value”,  I mean the case wherein you cannot see the concretisable link between the pursuit and your value for life (of course, if you lack value for life, you need to address that first, since that is the source of value (see: [The Standard of Value](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/1-standard-of-value.html)) and thus the root of motivation). Note that here, overload may be either for the pursuit itself or for the extent of engagement or effort in the pursuit, i.e. you may find concrete value in the pursuit but only to a certain point and/or in certain respects.

## Failure states
Conscious states (including emotional states) are or can be indicators of one’s efficacy in life. For example, pleasure (in some contexts) and happiness are indicators of success or efficacy in the pursuit of life. On the other hand, pain (in some contexts) and suffering are indicators of failure, inefficacy or frustration in the pursuit of life. However, there are more kinds of indicators and not every indication of success or failure can be taken as such without reason in a given context (e.g. pain in the context of muscle training is a part of a value-seeking process and not a sign of failure in the broader context). Here, I shall explore the states that are clear, unequivocal indications of failure in some form that point to an unsustainable state of existence that must be overcome.

Note that a state of suffering is the indication of failure in one’s life and/or one’s pursuit of values, which means each failure state is a form of suffering. It is also important to note that any state of suffering is not primarily subjective, even though it is indicated and experienced by one or more emotions. The source of the states and emotions in question is either a value judgement or a metaphysical judgement (i.e. a way of regarding the world), which means such states are objective (factual) indications about the state of one’s volitional mechanism (which includes all aspects of the self that one’s volition depends on or is affected by to varying degrees, including intellectual aspects, psychological aspects, neurological aspects, physiological aspects, etc.). Note that one’s volitional mechanism is what enables the pursuit of values. Hence, overcoming failure states is not a matter of sheer willpower but a rational approach to the facts about one’s volitional mechanism.


**NOTE**: _It is not the fact of suffering but what you do with that fact (e.g. understand the source of the suffering and overcome the suffering) that is morally relevant. In other words, there is value not in suffering but in overcoming it._

### Despair
Despair is, in essence, the view that one has no efficacy in pursuing one’s values, neither in the actual nor the potential; i.e. it is the lack of both confidence and hope. Such a state by itself literally deprives you of or at least diminishes your motive to act toward your values effectively, since the basis of motive — the recognition of potential — is lost. Hence, it is a failure state of being that must be overcome.

### Shame
Guilt and regret are, in essence, constructive emotions, since they instil in oneself the inclination to correct or learn from something that went wrong on one’s own account. Shame, on the other hand, is a potentially accompanying emotion that by itself offers no constructive inclinations; it is similar to pain, which can be a part of a worthy, constructive struggle, but which by itself is weakening or even debilitating. The way I understand it, shame by itself is the result of viewing oneself as lacking efficacy in both the actual and the potential; it is, in my view, a form of despair directed inward toward one’s own character. Such a state by itself also literally deprives you of or at least diminishes your self-value and thus your motive to act toward your own benefit effectively, and hence, it is a failure state of being that must be overcome.

To conclude on the nature of despair and shame, note that these are not constructive emotions. Of course, they are natural and can be a natural accompaniment to more constructive emotions. Furthermore, as indicators of failure, they are helpful in letting us know about the state of our own consciousness. But if on their own, unaccompanied by any constructive emotion, they must not be indulged but overcome as quickly and effectively as possible, because as failure states, they indicate an unsustainable, potentially unlivable state of existence.

**NOTE**: _Of course, a key aspect of being able to overcome such states in general is understanding their causes._

### How to overcome failure states
_A baseline of serenity_...

The essence of a failure state is the view of lacking efficacy in the pursuit of one’s own values. Evidently, then, to overcome them involves acquiring and recognising one’s own efficacy in this regard. But how is one to do it? At the most basic level, since facts are the material of cognition, i.e. the material needed for reason to operate and for effective, rational action to take place, efficacy at a basic level is derived from the recognition and acceptance of the facts, i.e. from a baseline of serenity. Note that recognition of the facts involves doing so for all the facts involved, including one’s own emotions, faults and/or merits, the good and/or the bad in one’s own character, etc. In other words, serenity is (epistemologically) the result of one’s pursuit of objectivity to one’s fullest capacity and is the basis for cognitive and moral efficacy.

_Fueling oneself in the moment_...

On top of this, acquiring concrete values that you can — e.g. rest, relaxation, enjoyment in the moment, other more obviously valuable pursuits, more obvious short-term ways of improving efficacy on some level, etc. — are ways to directly fuel your consciousness and its recognition of one’s own efficacy in life. However, note that such a fuel needs a practical mechanism in place to actually improve on one’s efficacy beyond the range-of-the-moment, and such a mechanism would be at least in part established by a baseline of serenity.

---

**Observations**:

_Why have I often failed at overcoming the lack of efficacy?_ In short, it is because I separated the pursuit of efficacy from the pursuit of life-affirmation (especially in the form of enjoyment), i.e. from the pursuit of seeking and experiencing concrete values (i.e. in the moment). I often thought of the “necessary” or “maintenance” aspects of my life as duties or responsibilities detached from my pursuit of values concretely (I have explained before why the concrete pursuit of values is essential in fueling oneself and driving one’s volitional mechanism). Hence, my pursuit of efficacy had served only to drain me, demotivate me in the short-term, deprive me of the will or the ability to keep going and destroy or make me lose my value for the long-term. On the other hand, my pursuit of life-affirmation being separated from my pursuit of efficacy meant that doing the things that I thought or felt affirmed my life (at least more than my “duties” or “responsibilities”) were not ultimately constructive or value-seeking (at least not sufficiently) in any broader context beyond the range-of-the-moment or some isolated/disconnected short-term period (and limited to such a context, no human values (i.e. values with respect to the standard of value that is life as a volitional being) are really possible since one’s ability to live effectively and one’s potential for life are ignored). Only by uniting them can I in fact achieve my pursuit of values consistently and sustainably.

_Hence, never separate your pursuit of efficacy from your pursuit of life-affirmation; know that they are and must be integrated. If they are not, both ultimately become and feel pointless._

# Judgement in practice
Ultimately, ideas are inseparable from actions, be they implicit ideas or explicitly stated ones. However, the exact nature of the relationship between ideas and actions are more complex, especially in more specific contexts. We shall look into their relationship to understand when and how to judge someone (including ourselves) based on ideas and actions.

## The link between ideas and actions
Ideas do not necessarily translate into actions, and the way they do is complex due to the following factors: (1) having an idea does not mean you have internalised it, (2) you cannot internalise an idea unless you concretise it through repetition and/or observation and/or action, (3) a complex idea that needs to be consciously brought to focus cannot be wholly internalised and automatised, (4) having and validating an idea does not necessarily mean you know how to translate it into action effectively (as an example, consider how proving a theorem in mathematics does not necessarily give you the skills to apply it in real-life problems; application is, in general, a different skill than validation), (5) ideas may be implicit, i.e. internalised subconsciously, hence making the ideological basis of your actions unclear or ambiguous.

Hence, we see that explicitly stated ideas are not necessarily internalised and not necessarily automatically translated into action (especially if they are more complex ideas), Furthermore, we see that actions may be based not on one's purported beliefs but on unstated perhapds unknown premises. Therefore, it is not necessarily valid to judge a person's character and actions based on his purported beliefs nor is it necessarily valid to assume a person explicitly endorses the viewpoint implicit in his actions.

## The link between philosophy and virtue
Virtue is the right philosophy put in practice. However, a philosophy by itself is not necessarily put into practice consciously nor is not automatically internalised just be learning it or even just by validating it. Furthermore, one's actions may be based on an implicit philosophy that has not been validated explicitly and may be apart from or at odds with one's explicit beliefs. Hence, a person's virtuousness cannot be judged necessarily by his purported philosophy, nor can a person's explicit viewpoint be inferred necessarily by his actions and/or virtues. For example, despite the mystical philosophies of most religions, a given religious person may have and practice life-affirming "this-worldly" virtues. As another example, a self-proclaimed subjectivist may in fact be a proponent of science and reason in practice.

## Superiority and inferiority
Having a standard of what is good (which is essential to have in any pursuit of value) necessarily implies relative superiority and inferiority with respect to the standard. As examples, consider: someone may be superior to someone else in mathematics, a mystical worldview is epistemologically inferior to an scientific one, the actions of a soldier fighting to defend his land are (all else equal) morally superior to the actions of a murderer, etc. We can also judge a character, culture, an aesthetic approach, etc. as inferior or superior to another based on the right standard. Acknowledging superiority or inferiority in the right context and wherever it exists is rational, i.e. in line with objectivity, and hence, it is right and moral to acknowledge superiority or inferiority where valid and necessary, since such acknowledgement is the extension of our acknowledgement of the good and of our rejection of the bad.

However, there are errors that can be made in such judgement. A superiority complex is the invalid assertion or assumption of superiority in one area based on superiority in another area. Of course, if the areas are related in a way such that superiority in one area implies superiority in another, then the assertion or assumption of superiority is valid. However, where such a relationship between the areas does not exist, the assertion or assumption of superiority is invalid, i.e. illogical. For example, a mathematical genius has a superiority complex if he assumed that his superiority in mathematics implies his superiority in intelligence as such. As another example, having a superior philosophy does not imply having superior virtues in every respect; even if you were consistent in the practice of your philosophy, you neither internalise every virtue more than someone else necessarily nor gain superior cognitive and practical ability in every area of life necessarily.

Similarly, an inferiority complex is the invalid assertion or assumption of inferiority in one area based on inferiority in another area. Again, of course, if the areas are related in a way such that inferiority in one area implies inferiority in another, then the assertion or assumption of inferiority is valid. However, where such a relationship between the areas does not exist, the assertion or assumption of inferiority is invalid, i.e. illogical. A well-observed example may be a child's feeling of inferiority in character and worth based on his academic inferiority. As another example, being inferior in some character traits does not imply being inferior as such, i.e. as a whole, and it certainly does not mean you cannot shape your character for the better.

A superiority or inferiority complex is wrong because it is irrational, i.e. non-objective, which means it clouds your judgement and thus your ability to know the reality of your capabilities, your achievements and your potential. In fact, the practice of these complexes results in vices; a practiced superiority complex leads to the vice of vanity whereas a practiced inferiority complex leads to the vice of humility. The virtue to strive for is the virtue of pride, i.e. moral ambitiousness (a term coined by Ayn Rand to define the virtue of pride). Note that moral ambitiousness derives from the virtue of rationality, i.e. objectivity in one's approach to life, which means that pride is an extension of rationality. Furthermore, pride being based on objectivity implies that key to the virtue of pride is the feeling of pride where it is valid, i.e. where it is the objective acknowledgement of one's own achievements and virtues. I shall expand on pride in the coming sections, but just to clarity what I mean by pride as opposed to a superiority or inferiority complex, pride is essentially the pursuit of what is best for you. Hence, having people superior to you in one or more virtuous respects is an advantage to you, a fuel for your pride and not a knock on your pride in any way, since by the example of the observably superior virtuousness, you get a directly observable grasp of what is right and possible in the pursuit of the good.

# Pride and moral perfection
**Main source**: [“Moral Ambition: Perfection and Pride, Part 1” by Tara Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-oP0BxZcks&list=PLce8-cUD6KMcUnyfBJkQhoFRHlmuIYkor&index=28)

## Pride as the key to the pursuit of values
### Pride as a virtue
Pride is both a feeling and a virtue. In this sense, it is both descriptive and prescriptive. The virtue of pride involves holding high standards of conduct and — consequently — of character. The feeling of pride is the result of and potentially a fuel for the virtue of pride. The virtue is primary; the feeling of pride without the virtue is vanity.

“_The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: “moral ambitiousness.”_ ” <br> — The Objectivist Ethics, “The Virtue of Selfishness” by Ayn Rand, page 27

**SIDE NOTE: Ayn Rand's full quote on pride (formatted into points)**:

The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: “moral ambitiousness.” It means that one must earn the right to hold oneself as one’s own highest value by achieving one’s own moral perfection — which one achieves

- By never accepting any code of irrational virtues impossible to practice and by never failing to practice the virtues one knows to be rational
- By never accepting an unearned guilt and never earning any, or, if one has earned it, never leaving it uncorrected
- By never resigning oneself passively to any flaws in one’s character
- Never placing any concern, wish, fear or mood of the moment above the reality of one’s own self-esteem.

Above all, it means one’s rejection of the role of a sacrificial animal, the rejection of any doctrine that preaches self-immolation as a moral virtue or duty.

---

Pride is the virtue corresponding to the value of self-esteem. Self-esteem is, in essence, the value for oneself. Combined with reason and purpose, the value of self-esteem is what makes all other values and consequently the pursuit of life possible. Hence, pride means achieving the value for oneself, and thus, the value for one’s own life.

### Practice of pride
Hence, we see that pride is not just evaluative of our actions and our self but also aspirational, as it defines the basis for one’s course of actions. But how to practise pride, i.e. act to achieve self-esteem?

- By identifying, accepting and striving to fully achieve objectively validated standards of conduct (action) and character (self).
- By shaping one’s character based on one’s moral ideal. <br> **NOTE 1**: _One’s character is shaped by internalised principles of conduct, which present themselves as habits, ambitions, and actions in general._ <br> **NOTE 2**: _Character exceeds wealth in value, because character is what makes the creation of wealth possible, especially long-range._

**What pride is not**:

- Pride is not obstinacy, i.e refusing to change one’s mind or course of action either (1) without good reasons for it, or (2) despite good reasons against it. <br> _Here, pride is not the cause of the issue, but rather, it is the lack of self-honesty and rationality._
- Pride is not derived from others’ opinions of us. <br> _To say it is, is second-handed. Such a view of pride does not result in the achievement of self-esteem. This view of pride is not pride, since pride concerns with:_
  - _One’s own objective evaluation of oneself._
  - _One’s adherence or actively pursued aspiration to one’s own moral standards._
- On a similar note, pride does not derive from comparison with other people, i.e. pride is not based on your judgement of the worth of other people’s conduct and character. <br> _Same reasoning as the last point. Furthermore, requiring comparison with other people on which to base one’s own standard of worthiness betrays one’s lack of objectively derived values, principles and moral ideals. How well a person is living up to his moral standards does not rely on how well other people are living up to their moral standards._
- Pride may or may not involve self-congratulatory expression. <br> _Such expression is not essential to pride, and may or may not accompany it._

**NOTE**: _Moral standards are not subjective but contextual, i.e. they are absolute abstract principles applied to the context of your life, capabilities, and situation._

### Pride as a key to a life-oriented ethics
To live (as a volitional being) requires a sense of self-value. But a human, whose defining characteristic is a volitional consciousness, has no automatic conscious values, i.e. no automatic values with respect to his existence as a conscious, volitional being. Now, note that life is the objective standard of value, where “life” in this context is the form of existence particular to a volitional being. To value life requires valuing the self, i.e. the entity that is doing the living. As any other conscious value, this value for oneself — self-esteem — is not automatic.

Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your highest value, because your life is the standard of your values. Like all values of a human, this value — self-esteem — has to be earned (i.e. achieved by enacting the right causes). This value is based on a volitional consciousness, so the right causes must also be based on conscious, volitional action. In other words, just as your value for your life must be pursued consciously and volitionally, so must your value for yourself.

**Pride recognises the following corollaries**:

- Of any achievement possible to you, the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your own character, i.e. of your internalised values, habits and code of conduct.
- Your character as well as your motivations are the product of the premises you hold — implicitly or explicitly — and the way you act on them.
- Just as a human must produce physical values to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values of character, i.e. spiritual values that make his life worth sustaining. In other words, a human is a being of self-made wealth and self-made soul.
- To earn self-esteem, one must shape his soul, i.e. his character and conscious experience, in the image of his moral ideal.

If life is the standard of value, then there can be no value placed higher than oneself. The full achievement of this standard and of one’s value for oneself is the egoism that desires the best in all things, in values of matter and spirit. At the base of such egoism is the aim to achieve one’s own moral perfection.

## Moral perfection
### Moral perfection is morality in practice
_First, some definitions_...

**Perfection**:

The full, consistent achievement of a standard, as defined in a certain context. Note that a standard defined out of context is not meant to be effective or even possible; it can be effective or possible only by accident. Note, hence, that perfection is contextual, with its only proper benchmark being reality as we know it and not fantasy.

**Moral perfection**:

The full, consistent achievement of one’s values in the context of one’s life and capacity to live, which includes one’s actuality and potentiality. The standard of moral perfection must be rational, i.e. with regards to what is possible and valuable in the context of one’s life.

---

_Back to the discussion_...

**Moral perfection is not**:

- Moral infallibility; no volitional consciousness can be infallible.
- A fixed state of perfection; life and thus the pursuit of morality (i.e. the code of values with life as the standard) is an active, lifelong commitment.
- The best possible imaginable.

---

**NOTE 1**: Moral fallibility simply means the ability to fail to make a moral choice. But moral failure is immoral by its nature. Hence, note that moral perfection does not mean you are unable to make an immoral choice — you are always able — but while moral perfection cannot coexist with moral failure, it can and does coexist with the ability for moral failure. This means, essentially, that volition is always operative in morality.

**NOTE 2**: Not all failure is moral failure, and failure by itself may have no bearing on morality!

---

**Moral perfection is**:

- Best possible in reality, i.e. with respect to rational objectives.
- Based on the context of the individual; involves following interrelated constraints:
  - _Time available_, imposed by the situation or allocated according to one’s hierarchy of values.
  - _Task_, with regards to its importance, requirements, etc.
  - _Doer_, with regards to experience, values, capacity (intellectual, psychological and physical), etc.

Morality must be based on reason with its standard being one’s own life (as defined for a volitional being). In this light, to be moral is to be perfectly moral, since any deliberate imperfection is a deliberate deviation from reason and from the moral standard (which is the source of values). When you allow yourself to deviate from reason and thus from life deliberately, you no longer operate with reason as the absolute and life as the standard, because on what basis would you now choose to be rational?

If you were rational, to be rational or not is not an open choice; rationality is the only valid option. Hence, when you allow yourself to deviate from reason deliberately, you adopt an irrational approach to life (insofar as you can live it irrationally), either implicitly or explicitly. In such a case, even when you choose to be rational, it would only be because you feel like it, not because reason is your standard of thought and action. In this way, you subvert the pursuit of your life and plant the seeds of your destruction.

_Whatever is anti-reason is anti-mind, and thus, anti-life and thereby immoral._

### Reality-based standard of perfection
“_The perfect person does not demand of himself the impossible, but he does demand of himself every ounce of the possible._” <br> — Leonard Peikoff

### Purpose of moral perfection
“_Moral perfection is not about genuflecting to some deity or to pursue morality as an end in itself. It’s not about keeping a good record in some official bookkeeping. Being perfectly moral is the only path to your values and your happiness._” <br> — Tara Smith

Hence, note that to be morally perfect is not the goal, but rather, it is the means to the goal of living life. Hence, do not obsess with moral perfection as such (as an end in itself), but rather, focus on life and your ability to live it. Moral imperfection is not a reason by itself to give up hope or value for yourself or your life, but rather, it is evidence of some spiritual need or lacking that must be addressed (and it is morally necessary to do so).
