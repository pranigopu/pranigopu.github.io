# Laying the foundations
The right internal effects need the right internal causes. Thus, to be motivated, you need to believe, i.e. internalise the right views, values and virtues, and to internalise them, you need to be convinced of them — for a rational person, to convince is to convince with truth and reason (evasion and irrationality destroy your capacity to think and act effectively, and thus, are not a valid alternatives to truth and reason). Intention and will are not omnipotent and do not circumvent the need for the right causes of motivation.

## The role of philosophy
Philosophy is the basis of the way in which you deal with reality, either implicitly or explicitly. To make it explicit is to bring it into conscious focus, thus bringing it into conscious action. While this is always important, this is especially important if your initial internalised (implicit) philosophy is poor. In learning or relearning the right philosophy explicitly, you reinforce and internalise — or begin to internalise — the basis of the way to deal with reality that is rational, self-motivated and happiness-oriented.

## Absolute conviction
Consciousness needs an apparatus to be effective; this apparatus includes the subconscious. The subconscious, to some degree, automates the process of perceiving that which exists and acting on its perception with respect to context (cognitive, moral and situational). Such automation is vital due to: (1) time and energy constraints (automation helps handle them most efficiently with respect to time and energy) and (2) constraints of focus (automation frees the focus for more conscious units).


**NOTE**: _Automation is more time and energy efficient than deliberation, but of course, deliberation has its own vital place in cognition and action. Time and energy efficiency does not mean efficiency as a whole, i.e. it does not necessarily mean keeping a low cost while maintaining the required effectiveness. To achieve efficiency as a whole (i.e. effectiveness with low cost) often requires deliberation too._


The vital role of the subconscious in one’s life means that the core values and principles one validates through reason must be internalised, i.e. made a part of the subconscious. Internalisation is, in essence, the unquestioned acceptance (within some context) of the validity of an idea (e.g. a value or principle). To question it is to bring it into conscious focus; this is vital in its own way, but is not rational (i.e. not practical, and often not even possible) to do in every case.

## Integrating the fundamentals with the expansion
_I am talking about philosophy, but it also applies generally in all fields of study._

The fundamentals of ideas as such serve to form a solid, reliable basis for your further learning that strengthens your ideas, convictions and actions in narrower contexts. However, the fundamentals by themselves — being very abstract — cannot inform you about more concrete cases, situations and issues. Hence, you need an expansion of your fundamentals into more concrete or specific contexts to understand their application. Note that this is not primarily a deductive process; you do not start with the fundamentals and merely deduce how to apply them. No, it is more of an inductive process (though, of course, applying logic in general will involve both induction and deduction), wherein you integrate your experiences as well as specific lessons and ideas either to the fundamentals or using the fundamentals, thereby forming new knowledge informing you about how to deal with more concrete or specific contexts. On the flip side, just focusing on the expansion, i.e. the concretes and the specifics can deprive you of the means to integrate or validate your conclusions and ground them in firm, retainable convictions that relate to other convictions. Such deprivation diminishes your overall capacity to act (since you would be swamped by particulars with no way to organise or integrate them).

Hence, you need to focus on both as required: the fundamentals and the expansion.

**Observations**:

<u>More specific principles are not enough</u>:

When first trying to concretise or apply my fundamentals (specifically in ethics), I tried to expand on the broader principles and obtain more specific principles that I could use (you can see these principles here: Principles for Life). While helpful and a good step forward, such principles are still too broad to depend on entirely. I realised that I needed more than more specific abstract principles. I needed experience and the integration of experience into learning, methods, approaches, perspectives, etc. All that (and maybe more) is necessary in order to successfully apply my basic philosophy in life. Broader abstractions and abstract principles are necessary, but they are not sufficient.

<u>Including informative failures and pitfalls that you experienced</u>:

When trying to discover the effective ways of applying my philosophy, I often ran into pitfalls, mistakes or flaws in my approach or thinking that led to certain failures or poor results. However, these failures and poor results served as important data to help point me in the right direction. Now, while documenting the right direction that I had learned, it was very beneficial to include where and why I had failed before; not only would it help me or others out of similar situations in the future, it could also serve to strengthen and validate the inductive process that led to the right conclusions.


**NOTE**: _The last observation above extends to the value of including concrete observations in general (successes, failures, attempts and others)._

# Integrating the short-term and the long-term
## Acceptance of reality
The acceptance of reality, i.e. the conscious affirmation of the facts of reality is the basis for rationality and thus for morality. Never place an "I wish" over an "it is", since doing so is means turning away from the real in favour of the unreal, i.e. about which you neither have nor seek knowledge. Accept reality for all that it is so you can effectively strive toward what can be, i.e. the pursuit of value presupposes the acknowledgement of truth.

## The basis of motivation and willpower
**LEXICAL NOTE**:

Motivation is the concrete experience of the value for a particular potential. Willpower is the self-driven capacity of the volitional faculty to exert effort in a particular direction of focus. Willpower and motivation are ultimately integrated in one's pursuit of value; willpower is the volitional effort to engage in a pursuit, motivation is the fuel that makes such engagement possible, especially long-range.

---

Motivation is based on life-affirmation in the moment and the focus on the facts. The focus on the facts is, in essence, in essential form of life-affirmation, since it affirms the basis of one's pursuit of life, namely the affirmation of reality. What does really mean in practice? In practice, look at reality, look at your motives, keep the factual context in mind and then following your motives to the fullest. In other words, do not divorce your motivation from the pursuit of values, but instead of trying to force your motivation through sheer willpower, acknowledge and accept your motives while staying in full focus of reality, i.e. of your relevant factual context. Most importantly, do not divorce the affirmation of life in the moment from the pursuit of efficacy, especially long-range. Why does it work?

The philosophical basis is clear: life is the standard of value and the ultimate value, which means it is what integrates every other value. In essence, every value is but one value, i.e. the value for one's life, applied in different ways to different contexts (see: ["Integrity of values" from The Nature of Value](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html#integrity-of-values)). However, the metaphysical source of the value for life (i.e. the source as present in reality) is necessarily the concrete affirmation of one's life, i.e. the self-motivated engagement with reality in the here and now (ranging from pleasure, enjoyment, etc. to focus, such as attentive focus, productive focus, etc. to recreation, relaxation, etc. to pain, serenity, struggle, etc.). Without such affirmation, no value exists and hence no motivation can sustain.

Consider it another way: why pursue something, short-term or long-term, if there is no purpose to it? If you gain nothing from life as you live it and thereby nothing fuels or sustains you for striving toward your potential, then how can you strive for any potential? Furthermore, why strive toward anything if not to ultimately to affirm life in the moment? If life is not affirmed in the here and now in some form, the value for it becomes a floating abstraction and thereby loses its tie to reality. Life is the source of purpose and thereby value, so if no affirmation of life pursued and achieved in some sense, then ultimately nothing is purposeful, and ultimately motivation dies out.

However, why follow your motivations to the fullest while keeping one's focus on reality rather than fight against motivations toward more "constructive" or long-range pursuits? Note that to "fight" one's motivations, I do not mean to engage in uncomfortable, difficult or even excruciating work — after all, motivation can persist even in great hardship and falter even in great comfort, so "pleasantness" is non-essential in motivation. Rather, by "fight" one's motivations, I mean act against your motives, i.e. act against what you most experience most concrete value for (e.g. emotionally, psychologically, morally, etc.). Now, consider the following points:

1.

The source of volition and therefore of willpower is one's ability to direct one's focus. Hence, ultimately, keeping one's focus on reality (which includes the factual context, one's philosophical convictions, one's hierarchy of values in a broader level, etc.) is the basic cause for the direction of one's motivation.

2.

One's volitional mechanism is finite in capacity and has a particular nature and range by which it operates; trying to operate one’s volition apart from its nature or outside its range leads to motivational overload, i.e. the failure to concretely value something. When in such a state, trying to push past it by mere effort is the denial of the nature of your volitional faculty and thereby a denial of reality. To put it in other words, willpower is finite (though renewable) not omnipotent even within one's own mind, and motivation is neither causeless nor subjective but rather based on one's internalised premises.

3.

Drawing from the second point, one's volitional mechanism can only operate when one's potential is concretised in some way and to some extent. This is because the basis of volition is long-range purpose, and the metaphysical basis of purpose is the concrete affirmation of life. To concretise potential is to concretise the values present in the pursuit of the potential; if such values do not exist, the pursuit cannot be sustained after a point.

---

Combining the above three points, we observe that fighting against one's motivations can at most be a short-range effort and cannot sustain long-range. Furthermore, relying only on one's sheer willpower to fight against "undesirable motivations" ignores the source of willpower itself, i.e. one's self-directed focus on reality and the conscious affirmation of the facts one grasps. Furthermore, it ignores the source of motivation, namely the concrete affirmation of life, i.e. the concrete experience of values, which is the metaphysical source of all values. Lastly, it is key to grasp that motivation, i.e. the concrete experience of one's value for a potential, is key to the operation of one's volitional mechanism; without such concrete experience, the value of the potential remains a floating abstraction, losing its ties to reality.

Summarising the point so far into a tip, the idea is: keep your focus on reality, do not practice self-abnegation but engage in full awareness and purpose with your motivations, check your core premises and ultimately let your premises and your focus on reality shape your motivations and thereby fuel your capacity to pursue a certain potential and thus sustain it sufficiently (be it short-range or long-range).

**NOTE**: _You can exert your willpower against your motivations, but only upto a point. Some short-term cases may occasionally call for such a use of willpower (e.g. emergencies or short deadlines), but note that it is not sustainable to do so and, if done as a practice, will lead you to become drained and unable to apply your willpower any further and potentially even unable to experience the value for life for a while._

_Expanding on motivational overload_...

Motivational overload follows from the same basic premise as cognitive overload: the mind — and thus, one’s volitional mechanism — has an identity, and can only function according to that identity. How to recognise motivational overload? When you experience no concrete value in a pursuit you are trying to act toward, you are motivationally overloaded with respect to that pursuit. Note that this is not the same as “not feeling like doing something”, at least not in the usual sense of the phrase (the usual sense being something akin to “it is unpleasant”, “it is painful”, etc.). Remember: you can be very motivated to do something hard or painful. Hence, by “experiencing no concrete value”,  I mean the case wherein you cannot see the clear link between the pursuit and your value for life (of course, if you lack value for life, you need to address that first, since that is the root of motivation; check 4. Root of motivation). Note that here, overload may be either for the pursuit itself or for the extent of engagement or effort in the pursuit, i.e. you may find concrete value in the pursuit but only to a certain point and/or in certain respects.

**Observations**:

1.

In the face of a deadline that was not too close but important to address (i.e. my semester 2 final assignments in 2024), I found that consciously and completely engaging with concretely enjoyable activities — such as watching a show I enjoyed — had two advantages compared to pushing against my desires and forcing myself to work. (1) I did not drain my willpower, and thus, did not drain my motivation and capacity to engage with valuable but uncomfortable work in general. (2) I was able to properly satisfy myself (since I did not keep undermining my pleasure with shame or despair) and move past my need for concrete enjoyment, and thus, was able to focus on more challenging work more effectively, leading to far more efficient work and substantial results. I would compare this case to that of starvation; when you are starved, it is hard to think of anything but food, not least because food is an essential need that must be satisfied to fuel yourself for other pursuits. In this light, note that I do not regard concrete enjoyment — or any form of life-affirmation — as something “to get over with” or a nuisance or an itch that must be addressed, but rather, as a vital, genuine need of my mind and for my life, just as food is a genuine need of the body and not a mere indulgence.

**KEY POINT**: _The above only applies if there is no evasion on your part about what you are doing and what may be its consequences to you. Only a full and true acceptance of reality as it is can ensure that such indulgence can be of any value and pleasure (in the true sense) to you; evasion is a cause of shame and despair, and thus, destroys enjoyment and life-affirmation._

2.

When I strain myself beyond my motivations, I tend to get drained in one or more respects; cognitively, emotionally or physically. Cognitive and physical drain are easier to overcome through rest, but emotional drain indicates a psychological experience of loss in values. Even if such a loss is worth the values involved, since the psychological aspect of motivation is what drives you, such a loss in fact drains you (at least temporarily) of the will to pursue your goals further (a good analogy would be the training of muscles). The psychological aspect can be shaped over time but often not immediately, and draining it in the short-run makes losing the context of and thus value for the long-run almost inevitable (e.g. (a) initial and intermediate stages of doing the final assignments of semester 2 in 2024, (b) December-January examination preparation in 2023-2024, wherein I lost the motivation for both job applications and studying, etc.).

## Further points on motivation

1.

Motivation has both an intellectual (abstract) and a psychological (concrete) aspect. Both are vital and must be integrated (at least over time); the abstract aspect integrates the relevant concretes and validates motivations in the right context, whereas the concrete aspect is what ultimately drives your actions. However, the concrete, i.e. psychological aspect is largely subconscious; the abstract, i.e. intellectual aspect is key in shaping the psychological aspect, but such shaping must be done logically (remember the analogy of a programmer — the intellectual aspect — and the computer — the psychological aspect). Thus, shaping your motivations may often be a matter of a more tactful, indirect approach rather than direct intent or willpower, especially in view of the complexity of your goals and of your means to achieve them.

2.

When you lack the motivation or capacity to do something in a given context, you literally — in fact — cannot do it of your own volition in that context. However, this need not incapacitate you; while you may lack the motivation or capacity to do something in the given context, you can shift your focus to improve your ability (e.g. by addressing more basic existential needs, mental or physical) or pursue something else (according to what you judge to be the most important or valuable in a broader context). Note that motivation can persevere in the hardest, most severe of conditions, and it can falter even in relative comfort; in general, it is not primarily a question of “what is going on outside” but “what is going on inside” (although, of course, both questions are important and potentially relevant to each other). Why is the motivation present or absent? Ask to understand its roots: what are its essential causes, what are the relevant factors in dealing with it, etc.? Understanding this is a part of understanding reality objectively so you can deal with it effectively. It is ineffective to try to brute-force your way through your lack of motivation because the facts about your consciousness (e.g. the nature of volition, finiteness of willpower, etc.) and its relationship to reality (e.g. how emotions and motives arise, what is the nature and role of values, how can and must a mind grasp the facts effectively, etc.) will not sustain it.

# Decision-making
## Rational decision-making is never automatic
With the right principles, methods and practice, rational decision-making can be greatly facilitated and become second nature, but it can never be automatic, no matter how much and how well you integrate your premises, your knowledge, your thoughts, your motives and your actions. Why? Because even after integrating, the fact remains that no non-self-evident knowledge is automatic. Note also that instinct and intuition, while invaluable, are not automatically valid either, especially not by default; you still need to validate whether they are applicable in the given context. Furthermore, the facts remains that (1) focus is still finite and (2) the right adherence to the facts and the right application of one's mental contents with respect to the given context are still not automatic, since they still require you to bring to focus the facts and the right parts of your mental contents with respect to the facts. Finally, the effort to apply one's knowledge through action also requires a conscious decision, since the application itself is not automatic and does not lead to an automatic action. Hence, while decision-making can get smoother and more efficient, it is never wholly automatic and certainly not automatic by default and in the long-range.

**NOTE**: _You can automate parts of decision-making as appropriate, but to know whether it is appropriate to do so also requires deliberate focus._
