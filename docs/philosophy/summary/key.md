**NOTE 1**: "Rational application of focus" involves the rational use of willpower and motivation. It is tied to efficiency, but since it is not merely a subset of efficiency and involves other wider principles, I decided to place it as a separate area of rationality in practice.

**NOTE 2**: "Love of existence" is the love of the fact of existence, which is inextricably tied to the love my own life and my own existence, i.e. self-value.
