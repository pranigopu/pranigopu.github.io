- Evasion is the root of vice
- Virtue and vice are not fixed states <br> _Volition is always operative in morality_
- Life is the source of value and purpose
- Life is the only end in itself
- By its nature, life is ongoing and continuous
- Value-seeking is continuous (see: [1](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html#values-seeking-is-continuous), [2](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/rationality-in-practice.html#principle-of-value-seeking))
