# Introduction


_First, some definitions_...


**Happiness**:


If values are defined with one's life as the standard, and if happiness is the psychological affirmation of life as an end in itself, then happiness is the state of the non-contradictory achievement of one's values. Since life in this context means life as a volitional being, life and thus happiness involve the integration of the actual and the potential, i.e. the short-range and the long-range. However, since life in this context refers to life as a whole rather than any given moment of life, happiness is the state of the non-contradictory achievement of one's values in the long-range, i.e. in one's life as a whole, with non-essential short-term losses being ultimately irrelevant to happiness.


**Suffering**:


With the same definition of values, if suffering is the psychological response to the undermining of one's life, suffering is the state of the frustration of one's values. Again, since life in this context means life as a volitional being, life and thus suffering involve the integration of the actual and the potential, i.e. the short-range and the long-range. However, since life in this context refers to life as a whole rather than any given moment of life, suffering is the state of the frustration of one's values in the long-range, i.e. in one's life as a whole, with non-essential short-term gains being ultimately irrelevant to suffering.

_Back to the discussion_...


If one's morality is the practical framework to pursue one's value for one's life in the broadest context available, then one's pursuit of life is defined by one's pursuit of happiness and not one's avoidance of suffering. However, the question is: what does the pursuit of happiness involve in practice? In essence, everything discussed in [_Philosophy in Practice_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/philosophy-in-practice), is part of what the pursuit of happiness involves. However, in this document, I shall look into the forms of direct, i.e. concrete experience of happiness to understand how to recognise, affirm and further pursue one's happiness in the moment.


# Key characteristics of happiness
Happiness is a state of consciousness arising from the non-contradictory achievement of values, but the state of the achievement of values is not static and does not imply any particular emotions, positive or negative. Hence, happiness is not a positive emotional state, nor does it consist only of positive emotional states. However, since happiness is a form of sustained, i.e. long-range life-affirmation, positive emotional states are a key characteristic of happiness in the long-term, but not necessarily at any given point or short-term period.


Therefore, a happy person is not the same as a joyous person, although a happy person can also be a joyous person. Joy is a powerful fuel for one's life and happiness but not the only feature of it. The same applies for enjoyment, pleasure, comfort, etc. Then, what characterises a happy person? Since happiness is a state of the non-contradictory achievement of values, the key characteristic of happiness is self-value, i.e. self-esteem. Furthermore, since purpose is a fundamental value in life and since happiness is a non-static state, happiness involves a purposeful state of existence, i.e. an active-minded and engaged state of existence. Thirdly, since rationality is the fundamental virtue in one's pursuit of life, happiness involves the wholehearted affirmation of one's grasp of reality; an evasive state of mind can never result in happiness. Lastly, since happiness is essentially a long-range state of consciousness, a key characteristic of happiness is the tendency toward experiencing values concretely, i.e. the tendency toward positive emotions, especially when compared to experiencing negative emotions.


# Happiness and emotional states
Based on the above conclusions, the essentials of happiness are self-value, engagement with reality, the affirmation of one's grasp of reality and the tendency toward the concrete experience of value; in short, pride, purpose, rationality and the tendency toward enjoyment. Hence, we can see that in the short-term, happiness is consistent with a neutral or even negative emotional state. In fact, since emotional states are the concrete responses of your mind to one's internalised value-judgement (i.e. one's judgement of the gain or loss of values), feeling a positive emotion when a neutral or negative emotion is appropriate is a sign of dysfunction and therefore does not imply happiness; if at all, it implies a lack of the capacity for happiness, at least for the time being. Hence, happiness can be consistent with the loss of short-range values that do not


However, since happiness cannot be consistent with the loss of essential or long-range values, the experience of heavy loss does impact happiness. In such a state, most of the essentials (namely pride, purpose and rationality) can still be present. However, due to the significance of the loss, one's tendency inevitably shifts (at least for a while) toward the experience of negative emotions. It is key to note, however, that even in heavy loss, as long as one values one's life, one's orientation in the long-range should be toward happiness ultimately. But reaching happiness ultimately requires the affirmation of one's loss, which requires the acceptance of some form of suffering, such as grief, and the acceptance of reality, i.e. serenity. For very heavy losses, the achievement of serenity can require mourning.
