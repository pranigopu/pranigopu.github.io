# Pride as the key to the pursuit of values
## Pride as a virtue
Pride is both a feeling and a virtue. In this sense, it is both descriptive and prescriptive. The virtue of pride involves holding high standards of conduct and — consequently — of character. The feeling of pride is the result of and potentially a fuel for the virtue of pride. The virtue is primary; the feeling of pride without the virtue is vanity.

"_The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: "moral ambitiousness."_ " <br> — The Objectivist Ethics, "The Virtue of Selfishness" by Ayn Rand, page 27

**SIDE NOTE: Ayn Rand's full quote on pride (formatted into points)**:

The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: "moral ambitiousness." It means that one must earn the right to hold oneself as one's own highest value by achieving one's own moral perfection — which one achieves

- By never accepting any code of irrational virtues impossible to practice and by never failing to practice the virtues one knows to be rational
- By never accepting an unearned guilt and never earning any, or, if one has earned it, never leaving it uncorrected
- By never resigning oneself passively to any flaws in one's character
- Never placing any concern, wish, fear or mood of the moment above the reality of one's own self-esteem.

Above all, it means one's rejection of the role of a sacrificial animal, the rejection of any doctrine that preaches self-immolation as a moral virtue or duty.

Pride is the virtue corresponding to the value of self-esteem. Self-esteem is, in essence, the value for oneself. Combined with reason and purpose, the value of self-esteem is what makes all other values and consequently the pursuit of life possible. Hence, pride means achieving the value for oneself, and thus, the value for one's own life.

## The practice of pride
Hence, we see that pride is not just evaluative of our actions and our self but also aspirational, as it defines the basis for one's course of actions. But how to practise pride, i.e. act to achieve self-esteem?

- By identifying, accepting and striving to fully achieve objectively validated standards of conduct (action) and character (self).
- By shaping one's character based on one's moral ideal. <br> **NOTE 1**: _One's character is shaped by internalised principles of conduct, which present themselves as habits, ambitions, and actions in general._ <br> **NOTE 2**: _Character exceeds wealth in value, because character is what makes the creation of wealth possible, especially long-range._

**What pride is not**:

- Pride is not obstinacy, i.e refusing to change one's mind or course of action either (1) without good reasons for it, or (2) despite good reasons against it. <br> _Here, pride is not the cause of the issue, but rather, it is the lack of self-honesty and rationality._
- Pride is not derived from others' opinions of us. <br> _To say it is, is second-handed. Such a view of pride does not result in the achievement of self-esteem. This view of pride is not pride, since pride concerns with:_
  - _One's own objective evaluation of oneself._
  - _One's adherence or actively pursued aspiration to one's own moral standards._
- On a similar note, pride does not derive from comparison with other people, i.e. pride is not based on your judgement of the worth of other people's conduct and character. <br> _Same reasoning as the last point. Furthermore, requiring comparison with other people on which to base one's own standard of worthiness betrays one's lack of objectively derived values, principles and moral ideals. How well a person is living up to his moral standards does not rely on how well other people are living up to their moral standards._
- Pride may or may not involve self-congratulatory expression. <br> _Such expression is not essential to pride, and may or may not accompany it._

**NOTE**: _Moral standards are not subjective but contextual, i.e. they are absolute abstract principles applied to the context of your life, capabilities, and situation._

## Pride as a key to a life-oriented ethics
To live (as a volitional being) requires a sense of self-value. But a human, whose defining characteristic is a volitional consciousness, has no automatic conscious values, i.e. no automatic values with respect to his existence as a conscious, volitional being. Now, note that life is the objective standard of value, where "life" in this context is the form of existence particular to a volitional being. To value life requires valuing the self, i.e. the entity that is doing the living. As any other conscious value, this value for oneself — self-esteem — is not automatic.

Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your highest value, because your life is the standard of your values. Like all values of a human, this value — self-esteem — has to be earned (i.e. achieved by enacting the right causes). This value is based on a volitional consciousness, so the right causes must also be based on conscious, volitional action. In other words, just as your value for your life must be pursued consciously and volitionally, so must your value for yourself.

**Pride recognises the following corollaries**:

- Of any achievement possible to you, the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your own character, i.e. of your internalised values, habits and code of conduct.
- Your character as well as your motivations are the product of the premises you hold — implicitly or explicitly — and the way you act on them.
- Just as a human must produce physical values to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values of character, i.e. spiritual values that make his life worth sustaining. In other words, a human is a being of self-made wealth and self-made soul.
- To earn self-esteem, one must shape his soul, i.e. his character and conscious experience, in the image of his moral ideal.

If life is the standard of value, then there can be no value placed higher than oneself. The full achievement of this standard and of one's value for oneself is the egoism that desires the best in all things, in values of matter and spirit. At the base of such egoism is the aim to achieve one's own moral perfection.

# Moral perfection
## Moral perfection is morality in practice
_First, some definitions_...

**Perfection**:

The full, consistent achievement of a standard, as defined in a certain context. Note that a standard defined out of context is not meant to be effective or even possible; it can be effective or possible only by accident. Note, hence, that perfection is contextual, with its only proper benchmark being reality as we know it and not fantasy.

**Moral perfection**:

The full, consistent achievement of one's values in the context of one's life and capacity to live, which includes one's actuality and potentiality. The standard of moral perfection must be rational, i.e. with regards to what is possible and valuable in the context of one's life.

_Back to the discussion_...

**Moral perfection is not**:

- Moral infallibility; no volitional consciousness can be infallible.
- A fixed state of perfection; life and thus the pursuit of morality (i.e. the code of values with life as the standard) is an active, lifelong commitment.
- The best possible imaginable.

---

**NOTE 1**: Moral fallibility simply means the ability to fail to make a moral choice. But moral failure is immoral by its nature. Hence, note that moral perfection does not mean you are unable to make an immoral choice — you are always able — but while moral perfection cannot coexist with moral failure, it can and does coexist with the ability for moral failure. This means, essentially, that volition is always operative in morality.

**NOTE 2**: Not all failure is moral failure, and failure by itself may have no bearing on morality!

---

**Moral perfection is**:

- Best possible in reality, i.e. with respect to rational objectives.
- Based on the context of the individual; involves following interrelated constraints:
  - _Time available_, imposed by the situation or allocated according to one's hierarchy of values.
  - _Task_, with regards to its importance, requirements, etc.
  - _Doer_, with regards to experience, values, capacity (intellectual, psychological and physical), etc.

Morality must be based on reason with its standard being one's own life (as defined for a volitional being). In this light, to be moral is to be perfectly moral, since any deliberate imperfection is a deliberate deviation from reason and from the moral standard (which is the source of values). When you allow yourself to deviate from reason and thus from life deliberately, you no longer operate with reason as the absolute and life as the standard, because on what basis would you now choose to be rational?

If you were rational, to be rational or not is not an open choice; rationality is the only valid option. Hence, when you allow yourself to deviate from reason deliberately, you adopt an irrational approach to life (insofar as you can live it irrationally), either implicitly or explicitly. In such a case, even when you choose to be rational, it would only be because you feel like it, not because reason is your standard of thought and action. In this way, you subvert the pursuit of your life and plant the seeds of your destruction.

_Whatever is anti-reason is anti-mind, and thus, anti-life and thereby immoral._

## Reality-based standard of perfection
"_The perfect person does not demand of himself the impossible, but he does demand of himself every ounce of the possible._" <br> — Leonard Peikoff

## Purpose of moral perfection
"_Moral perfection is not about genuflecting to some deity or to pursue morality as an end in itself. It's not about keeping a good record in some official bookkeeping. Being perfectly moral is the only path to your values and your happiness._" <br> — Tara Smith

Hence, note that to be morally perfect is not the goal, but rather, it is the means to the goal of living life. Hence, do not obsess with moral perfection as such (as an end in itself), but rather, focus on life and your ability to live it. Moral imperfection is not a reason by itself to give up hope or value for yourself or your life, but rather, it is evidence of some spiritual need or lacking that must be addressed (and it is morally necessary to do so).
