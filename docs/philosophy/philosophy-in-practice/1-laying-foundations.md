# Laying the foundations
The right internal effects need the right internal causes. Thus, to be motivated, you need to believe, i.e. internalise the right views, values and virtues, and to internalise them, you need to be convinced of them — for a rational person, to convince is to convince with truth and reason (evasion and irrationality destroy your capacity to think and act effectively, and thus, are not a valid alternatives to truth and reason). Intention and will are not omnipotent and do not circumvent the need for the right causes of motivation.

# The role of philosophy
Philosophy is the basis of the way in which you deal with reality, either implicitly or explicitly. To make it explicit is to bring it into conscious focus, thus bringing it into conscious action. While this is always important, this is especially important if your initial internalised (implicit) philosophy is poor. In learning or relearning the right philosophy explicitly, you reinforce and internalise — or begin to internalise — the basis of the way to deal with reality that is rational, self-motivated and happiness-oriented.

# The acceptance of reality
The acceptance of reality, i.e. the conscious affirmation of the facts of reality is the basis for rationality and thus for morality. Never place an "I wish" over an "it is", since doing so means turning away from the real in favour of the unreal, i.e. that which you neither have nor seek knowledge about. Accept reality for all that it is so you can effectively strive toward what can be, i.e. the pursuit of value presupposes the acknowledgement of truth.

## Wholehearted acceptance of the past and the potential
By causality, what has happened is not open to change. Understanding this is key to understanding that (1) one cannot validly wish for the past to not have happened, and that (2) what happened had to have happened due to the causes that were present. At the same time, it is true that the potential is open to change to some extent. Hence, we do not live in a predetermined universe, but at the same time, what has happened was necessary given the causes that were present. Furthermore, the past can lead to our awareness of things that can help us change the future for the better; without the past having occurred, the lessons and motivations that led to our awareness of what to do and not to do would have no basis and thus would not exist.

## Acknowledging one's own causal inefficacy or lack thereof
We, as volitional beings, have the capacity to act toward a potential chosen by us, provided it is possible. However, our capacity is necessarily finite, since metaphysically, nothing can be actually infinite, only potentially infinite. In particular, we have a finite capacity in terms of:

- Focus and retention
- Motivation and willpower
- Experience and knowledge
- Mental integration

If, in our knowledge, we lacked the awareness, motivation, willpower, experience, knowledge or mental integrative power to deal with something, then we lacked the capacity to deal with it. For example, if I were not aware of a risk in an endeavour and then faced the consequences, I have to accept that the consequences were practically unavoidable since the right causes that would lead me to avoid them were not present. Even if I could have known something whose relevance was outside my focus and thus outside my awareness, I have to accept that though I did what I could, the consequences have to borne. On the other hand, it is irrational and immoral to evade my responsiblity to focus, exercise my will with respect to experience and knowledge and integrate the facts to the best of my capacity if and when I can.

## Acknowledging failures
If you failed in some pursuit, whether it was your moral and/or practical fault or not, you must accept the failure and the lessons therefrom. Regret and guilt are valid and must be accepted only insofar as they build on your experience and do not hamper your ability to seize the moment to the best of your ability. To chastise yourself for failures (including moral failures) is invalid if, to the best of your knowledge, you have either atoned or corrected for them to the best of your ability. If there is more to do but cannot be done yet, hold onto your regret and guilt only up to that point and no further. Acknowledge the harm and loss as well as what needs to be done and what needs to be learnt.

Furthermore, never chastise yourself for the sake of chastising yourself; self-punishment, if done at all, is always a means to an end, and the end is the internalisation of the lessons learnt and the motivation toward correcting the harms or losses incurred to the best of your ability. Beyond this point, self-punishment is irrational and immoral, leading to the degradation or destruction of one's efficacy in life and ultimately to self-destruction.

## Accepting the facts before evaluating them
If something happens, it happens; it must be accepted without protest (internal or external). However, the facts must not be accepted passively; it is your rational and moral responsibiltiy to evaluate the facts, grasp their nature and grasp your own causal efficacy or lack thereof regarding the facts. Once you evaluate the facts, you act accordingly, accepting what you cannot change and changing what you can and must. If you failed, be it morally and/or practically, acknowledge them for what they are and never wish for the past to change (note that acknowledging failures has been discussed in the previous section).

# Conviction
## Need of absolute conviction
Consciousness needs an apparatus to be effective; this apparatus includes the subconscious. The subconscious, to some degree, automates the process of perceiving that which exists and acting on its perception with respect to context (cognitive, moral and situational). Such automation is vital due to: (1) time and energy constraints (automation helps handle them most efficiently with respect to time and energy) and (2) constraints of focus (automation frees the focus for more conscious units). An illustrative analogy of the relationship between the conscious and the subconscious is the relationship between a programmer and a computer. The computer is far more powerful (in processing capacity) than the programmer, but the programmer needs to and is able to direct and shape the actions and behaviour of the computer through the use of the right method.

**NOTE**: _Automation is more time and energy efficient than deliberation, but of course, deliberation has its own vital place in cognition and action. Time and energy efficiency does not mean efficiency as a whole, i.e. it does not necessarily mean keeping a low cost while maintaining the required effectiveness. To achieve efficiency as a whole (i.e. effectiveness with low cost) often requires deliberation too._

The vital role of the subconscious in one's life means that the core values and principles one validates through reason must be internalised, i.e. made a part of the subconscious. Internalisation is, in essence, the unquestioned acceptance (within some context) of the validity of an idea (e.g. a value or principle). To question it is to bring it into conscious focus; this is vital in its own way, but is not rational (i.e. not practical, and often not even possible) to do in every case.

Such unquestioned acceptance — i.e. absolute conviction — can have 3 sources: (1) faith (unquestioned acceptance from the start), (2) reason (rigorous validation as the basis of unquestioned acceptance) and (3) self-evidence. The self-evident cannot be questioned by its nature, because even to question it would be to accept it, implicitly or explicitly (in this way, it can be shown what is or is not self-evident). In other words, the self-evident is unquestionable by its nature not due to forces trying to stop questions but due to the nature of its existence as such. Hence, the self-evident is the basis of reason.

**NOTE**: _While the existence of the self-evident is inescapable because of the inescapable fact of existence itself, very few things are self-evident, and one must be scrupulous in deeming something to be self-evident._

A key aspect of rational consciousness is fallibility. Why? Reason is a faculty that must be exercised by volition and volition means the choice to focus (integration—a key part of reason—is a result of focus). But focus is finite, which means it does not always seek and hold all the parts of the necessary context. However, when focus can seek and hold all parts of the necessary context, reason can be validated so as to be unquestionable. Can such a case be identified? The answer yes, it can, through (1) the affirmation of the self-evident, (2) the affirmation of the aspects of the self-evident, and (3) the affirmation of the logical necessity of a relationship between the self-evident and another object of consideration (note that the laws of logic are themselves the affirmation of the aspects of the self-evident, namely the fact of existence and the law of identity).

**NOTE**: _Being fallible means not that certainty is impossible, only that certainty is not automatic._

If steps (1), (2) and (3) create the context, then this context is one wherein reason can be validated so as to be unquestionable. Such is the case with metaphysical truths, the epistemological truths and the standard of value in ethics. Thus, once validated, these can and must be accepted unquestioned as if an article of faith. But why not use articles of faith? Because, as stated, volition and hence ability to know reality are finite and thus fallible, which means no article of faith is sure to be true to reality. But being true to reality is the way to deal with it to achieve ends within it; thus, the use of faith over reason is unconscionable in its recklessness — you leave your ability to deal with reality entirely to chance (which may or may not favour you). Hence, the unquestioned acceptance and thus the absolute conviction found in faith is vital to human life (especially long-range); the issue is not unquestioned acceptance but its source — is it the self-evident and the rational or the arbitrary?

## The danger of non-absolutism
Note that introducing doubt without reason (e.g. by professing uncertainty when certainty is possible and proper) undermines the internalisation of valid notions, thus undermining your ability to act, especially when in pressure, hardship or distress. To put it in other words, a non-absolute conviction is necessarily a wavering conviction on some level, and a wavering conviction is not a firm basis for confidence or courage and in fact undermines them on some level; this is only valuable if there is a rational basis for doubt or a lack of rational basis for certainty. But if certainty is achieved or achievable in the given context, leaving your conviction wavering undermines your pursuit of life on some level because rationally earned confidence and courage — which cannot be reached with a wavering conviction — are vital in pursuing, upholding and defending one’s values effectively and consistently.

_To reframe the above point in more essential terms_...

Motivation is based on one’s internalised premises; shaky premises lead to shaky motivations that would be too weak to withstand challenges and adversity beyond a certain point. Hence, certainty is the basis for persevering motivation and thereby confidence, courage and one’s ultimately one’s pursuit of values.

## The danger of irrational absolutism
Whatever you profess, if you internalise a notion to the point of it being automatic, you — in practice — accept it as an absolute. Hence, the question is not whether to accept absolute but what absolutes to accept. Note that if what you call “confidence” or “courage” are irrational, i.e. not based on one’s rational judgement of the facts, then they are dangerous to oneself and others in principle, possibly to the point of being suicidal; in such a case, “confidence” is in fact presumptuousness or arrogance, while “courage” is in fact recklessness or foolhardiness.

## “Threats” to conviction
A conviction can only be under “threat” (from the perspective of the one holding the conviction) if one senses or feels that one’s efficacy in reality would be diminished, degraded or destroyed if one’s convictions were challenged. However, in my view, such a fear betrays an evasiveness at the root of one’s convictions, because only an evasion requires that it not be challenged in order to be sustained; reality is the evasive mind’s greatest antagonist. On the other hand, a conviction drawn from a rational grasp of reality cannot be threatened by opposing views because reality is what it is as an absolute and reason is the valid means of knowing it. Only a scrupulously, fundamentally rational view cannot be threatened, and only a person with reason as his absolute can explore opposing views without fearing the destruction of the ground beneath his feet.

# Integrating the fundamentals with the expansion
_I am talking about philosophy, but it also applies generally in all fields of study._

The fundamentals of ideas as such serve to form a solid, reliable basis for your further learning that strengthens your ideas, convictions and actions in narrower contexts. However, the fundamentals by themselves — being very abstract — cannot inform you about more concrete cases, situations and issues. Hence, you need an expansion of your fundamentals into more concrete or specific contexts to understand their application. Note that this is not primarily a deductive process; you do not start with the fundamentals and merely deduce how to apply them. No, it is more of an inductive process (though, of course, applying logic in general will involve both induction and deduction), wherein you integrate your experiences as well as specific lessons and ideas either to the fundamentals or using the fundamentals, thereby forming new knowledge informing you about how to deal with more concrete or specific contexts. On the flip side, just focusing on the expansion, i.e. the concretes and the specifics can deprive you of the means to integrate or validate your conclusions and ground them in firm, retainable convictions that relate to other convictions. Such deprivation diminishes your overall capacity to act (since you would be swamped by particulars with no way to organise or integrate them).

Hence, you need to focus on both as required: the fundamentals and the expansion.

**Observations**:

_More specific principles are not enough_...

When first trying to concretise or apply my fundamentals (specifically in ethics), I tried to expand on the broader principles and obtain more specific principles that I could use (you can see these principles here: Principles for Life). While helpful and a good step forward, such principles are still too broad to depend on entirely. I realised that I needed more than more specific abstract principles. I needed experience and the integration of experience into learning, methods, approaches, perspectives, etc. All that (and maybe more) is necessary in order to successfully apply my basic philosophy in life. Broader abstractions and abstract principles are necessary, but they are not sufficient.

_Including informative failures and pitfalls that you experienced_...

When trying to discover the effective ways of applying my philosophy, I often ran into pitfalls, mistakes or flaws in my approach or thinking that led to certain failures or poor results. However, these failures and poor results served as important data to help point me in the right direction. Now, while documenting the right direction that I had learned, it was very beneficial to include where and why I had failed before; not only would it help me or others out of similar situations in the future, it could also serve to strengthen and validate the inductive process that led to the right conclusions.

**NOTE**: _The last observation above extends to the value of including concrete observations in general (successes, failures, attempts and others)._
