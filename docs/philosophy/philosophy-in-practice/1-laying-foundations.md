# Laying the foundations
The right internal effects need the right internal causes. Thus, to be motivated, you need to believe, i.e. internalise the right views, values and virtues, and to internalise them, you need to be convinced of them — for a rational person, to convince is to convince with truth and reason (evasion and irrationality destroy your capacity to think and act effectively, and thus, are not a valid alternatives to truth and reason). Intention and will are not omnipotent and do not circumvent the need for the right causes of motivation.

# The role of philosophy
Philosophy is the basis of the way in which you deal with reality, either implicitly or explicitly. To make it explicit is to bring it into conscious focus, thus bringing it into conscious action. While this is always important, this is especially important if your initial internalised (implicit) philosophy is poor. In learning or relearning the right philosophy explicitly, you reinforce and internalise — or begin to internalise — the basis of the way to deal with reality that is rational, self-motivated and happiness-oriented.

# Conviction
## Need of absolute conviction
Consciousness needs an apparatus to be effective; this apparatus includes the subconscious. The subconscious, to some degree, automates the process of perceiving that which exists and acting on its perception with respect to context (cognitive, moral and situational). Such automation is vital due to: (1) time and energy constraints (automation helps handle them most efficiently with respect to time and energy) and (2) constraints of focus (automation frees the focus for more conscious units). An illustrative analogy of the relationship between the conscious and the subconscious is the relationship between a programmer and a computer. The computer is far more powerful (in processing capacity) than the programmer, but the programmer needs to and is able to direct and shape the actions and behaviour of the computer through the use of the right method.

**NOTE**: _Automation is more time and energy efficient than deliberation, but of course, deliberation has its own vital place in cognition and action. Time and energy efficiency does not mean efficiency as a whole, i.e. it does not necessarily mean keeping a low cost while maintaining the required effectiveness. To achieve efficiency as a whole (i.e. effectiveness with low cost) often requires deliberation too._

The vital role of the subconscious in one's life means that the core values and principles one validates through reason must be internalised, i.e. made a part of the subconscious. Internalisation is, in essence, the unquestioned acceptance (within some context) of the validity of an idea (e.g. a value or principle). To question it is to bring it into conscious focus; this is vital in its own way, but is not rational (i.e. not practical, and often not even possible) to do in every case.

Such unquestioned acceptance — i.e. absolute conviction — can have 3 sources: (1) faith (unquestioned acceptance from the start), (2) reason (rigorous validation as the basis of unquestioned acceptance) and (3) self-evidence. The self-evident cannot be questioned by its nature, because even to question it would be to accept it, implicitly or explicitly (in this way, it can be shown what is or is not self-evident). In other words, the self-evident is unquestionable by its nature not due to forces trying to stop questions but due to the nature of its existence as such. Hence, the self-evident is the basis of reason.

**NOTE**: _While the existence of the self-evident is inescapable because of the inescapable fact of existence itself, very few things are self-evident, and one must be scrupulous in deeming something to be self-evident._

A key aspect of rational consciousness is fallibility. Why? Reason is a faculty that must be exercised by volition and volition means the choice to focus (integration—a key part of reason—is a result of focus). But focus is finite, which means it does not always seek and hold all the parts of the necessary context. However, when focus can seek and hold all parts of the necessary context, reason can be validated so as to be unquestionable. Can such a case be identified? The answer yes, it can, through (1) the affirmation of the self-evident, (2) the affirmation of the aspects of the self-evident, and (3) the affirmation of the logical necessity of a relationship between the self-evident and another object of consideration (note that the laws of logic are themselves the affirmation of the aspects of the self-evident, namely the fact of existence and the law of identity).

**NOTE**: _Being fallible means not that certainty is impossible, only that certainty is not automatic._

If steps (1), (2) and (3) create the context, then this context is one wherein reason can be validated so as to be unquestionable. Such is the case with metaphysical truths, the epistemological truths and the standard of value in ethics. Thus, once validated, these can and must be accepted unquestioned as if an article of faith. But why not use articles of faith? Because, as stated, volition and hence ability to know reality are finite and thus fallible, which means no article of faith is sure to be true to reality. But being true to reality is the way to deal with it to achieve ends within it; thus, the use of faith over reason is unconscionable in its recklessness — you leave your ability to deal with reality entirely to chance (which may or may not favour you). Hence, the unquestioned acceptance and thus the absolute conviction found in faith is vital to human life (especially long-range); the issue is not unquestioned acceptance but its source — is it the self-evident and the rational or the arbitrary?

## The danger of non-absolutism
Note that introducing doubt without reason (e.g. by professing uncertainty when certainty is possible and proper) undermines the internalisation of valid notions, thus undermining your ability to act, especially when in pressure, hardship or distress. To put it in other words, a non-absolute conviction is necessarily a wavering conviction on some level, and a wavering conviction is not a firm basis for confidence or courage and in fact undermines them on some level; this is only valuable if there is a rational basis for doubt or a lack of rational basis for certainty. But if certainty is achieved or achievable in the given context, leaving your conviction wavering undermines your pursuit of life on some level because rationally earned confidence and courage — which cannot be reached with a wavering conviction — are vital in pursuing, upholding and defending one’s values effectively and consistently.

_To reframe the above point in more essential terms_...

Motivation is based on one’s internalised premises; shaky premises lead to shaky motivations that would be too weak to withstand challenges and adversity beyond a certain point. Hence, certainty is the basis for persevering motivation and thereby confidence, courage and one’s ultimately one’s pursuit of values.

## The danger of irrational absolutism
Whatever you profess, if you internalise a notion to the point of it being automatic, you — in practice — accept it as an absolute. Hence, the question is not whether to accept absolute but what absolutes to accept. Note that if what you call “confidence” or “courage” are irrational, i.e. not based on one’s rational judgement of the facts, then they are dangerous to oneself and others in principle, possibly to the point of being suicidal; in such a case, “confidence” is in fact presumptuousness or arrogance, while “courage” is in fact recklessness or foolhardiness.

## “Threats” to conviction
A conviction can only be under “threat” (from the perspective of the one holding the conviction) if one senses or feels that one’s efficacy in reality would be diminished, degraded or destroyed if one’s convictions were challenged. However, in my view, such a fear betrays an evasiveness at the root of one’s convictions, because only an evasion requires that it not be challenged in order to be sustained; reality is the evasive mind’s greatest antagonist. On the other hand, a conviction drawn from a rational grasp of reality cannot be threatened by opposing views because reality is what it is as an absolute and reason is the valid means of knowing it. Only a scrupulously, fundamentally rational view cannot be threatened, and only a person with reason as his absolute can explore opposing views without fearing the destruction of the ground beneath his feet.

# Integrating the fundamentals with the expansion
_I am talking about philosophy, but it also applies generally in all fields of study._

The fundamentals of ideas as such serve to form a solid, reliable basis for your further learning that strengthens your ideas, convictions and actions in narrower contexts. However, the fundamentals by themselves — being very abstract — cannot inform you about more concrete cases, situations and issues. Hence, you need an expansion of your fundamentals into more concrete or specific contexts to understand their application. Note that this is not primarily a deductive process; you do not start with the fundamentals and merely deduce how to apply them. No, it is more of an inductive process (though, of course, applying logic in general will involve both induction and deduction), wherein you integrate your experiences as well as specific lessons and ideas either to the fundamentals or using the fundamentals, thereby forming new knowledge informing you about how to deal with more concrete or specific contexts. On the flip side, just focusing on the expansion, i.e. the concretes and the specifics can deprive you of the means to integrate or validate your conclusions and ground them in firm, retainable convictions that relate to other convictions. Such deprivation diminishes your overall capacity to act (since you would be swamped by particulars with no way to organise or integrate them).

Hence, you need to focus on both as required: the fundamentals and the expansion.

**Observations**:

_More specific principles are not enough_...

When first trying to concretise or apply my fundamentals (specifically in ethics), I tried to expand on the broader principles and obtain more specific principles that I could use (you can see these principles here: Principles for Life). While helpful and a good step forward, such principles are still too broad to depend on entirely. I realised that I needed more than more specific abstract principles. I needed experience and the integration of experience into learning, methods, approaches, perspectives, etc. All that (and maybe more) is necessary in order to successfully apply my basic philosophy in life. Broader abstractions and abstract principles are necessary, but they are not sufficient.

_Including informative failures and pitfalls that you experienced_...

When trying to discover the effective ways of applying my philosophy, I often ran into pitfalls, mistakes or flaws in my approach or thinking that led to certain failures or poor results. However, these failures and poor results served as important data to help point me in the right direction. Now, while documenting the right direction that I had learned, it was very beneficial to include where and why I had failed before; not only would it help me or others out of similar situations in the future, it could also serve to strengthen and validate the inductive process that led to the right conclusions.

**NOTE**: _The last observation above extends to the value of including concrete observations in general (successes, failures, attempts and others)._
