# Introduction
_Here, we consolidate and make explicit what was implicit in the previous discussions in_ [**Philosophy in Practice**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/philosophy-in-practice).

In my understanding, emotions are an automatic psychological response to the gain or loss of values or potential values (note that psychological means based on the subconscious mind, i.e. based on internalised premises). The pleasure-pain mechanism is the basic physiological counterpart of emotions, where we experience physical sensations, i.e. automatic physical responses to the gain or loss of values or potential values.

Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism is our means of knowing about aspects of our physical state of being that are key to our physical existence and well-being, the emotional mechanism is our means of knowing about aspects of our conscious state of being that are key to our conscious existence and well-being. Note that when I say "means of knowing", I do not mean "means of cognition"; emotions do not necessarily correspond to the facts, but rather, they are facts themselves and serve as the key material for introspection. For example, feeling scared does not necessarily mean there is something to be afraid of objectively, but it does give you the fact that you are feeling fear, which gives you the basis to explore and/or validate the causes behind your feeling of fear.

Furthermore, just as the pleasure-pain mechanism is a fuel for our physical existence (e.g. pleasure motivates us toward something while pain motivates us away from it), the emotional mechanism is a fuel for our conscious existence; it is what drives our actions ultimately, i.e. in concrete terms.

# Emotions and willpower
Since the emotional mechanism is based on values, and since values are based on our premises ultimately, the emotional mechanism is shaped ultimately by our mental and physical practices. Furthermore, since values can and must be shaped by volition, the emotional mechanism also can and must be shaped by volition. It is key to note that volition here is not direct willpower toward something but our conscious grasp of reality. The premises we hold are the basis for values and thereby emotions, which means it is irrational and therefore ineffective to try to force emotions; it cannot be done except as a pretense.

Hence, as with life as whole, dealing with emotions effectively requires a rational focus on reality rather than brute willpower alone. Willpower must be directed not toward emotions themselves but toward the cause of emotions, namely our conscious grasp of reality, i.e. our clarity of focus and our use of reason. Hence, far from reason and emotion being at odds with each other, reason is the means by which emotion can be brought into harmony with one's pursuit of life and happiness.

# Invalid emotions
Emotions by their nature reflect our premises but do not reflect their validity; hence, an emotion may be invalid in the sense that it is a response based on invalid premises. How to take such emotions into account? Firstly, it is key to note that an invalid premise does not by itself reveal a moral failure; a perfectly moral person can make honest mistakes and thus reach mistaken premises. Secondly, invalid emotions are often important in revealing invalid premises (as we shall see); since we are not infallible, the ability to experience such emotions is a valuable ability.

_How to recognise valid and invalid emotions?_

One way is to recognise and validate or invalidate the premises underlying the emotion. Another way is to keep in mind a set of emotions that necessarily arise due to invalid preimises; we shall discuss this set of emotions in the coming subsections. Finally, conflicts in our emotions indicate conflicts in our premises, indicating logical and/or factual inconsistency on some level.

**NOTE: Emotion is not the primary target**:

It is not primarily emotions we must deal with or overcome, but rather their causes, i.e. the internalised premises that guide our intellectual and psyhological mechanisms. Emotions are important effects of these, but they are ultimately effects and not the driving causes of one's well-being.

**NOTE: Reiterating a key point**:

Invalid emotions are not to be overcome by sheer force of will but through one's clarity of focus and one's use of reason.

## Despair and shame: A false view of one's basic efficacy
This is discussed further here: [_Sources of Inefficacy_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/philosophy-in-practice/3-sources-of-inefficacy.html). To summarise for reference, the emotions of despair and shame arise due to an invalid view of one's basic efficacy in dealing with reality.

## Envy: An out-of-context view of value and loss
In my understanding, envy is a distinctive emotion that is not merely a combination of the emotional pain caused by another's possession or achievement and the desire to have what the other has. Rather, envy is a desire rooted in the emotional pain caused by another's possession or achievement, i.e. it is the desire primarily to overcome such a pain. On what basis do I make such a distinction? Observe: acting in envy, a person may either try to have or surpass what the other has, but he may also try to diminish or destroy what the other has. The uniting characteristic in both cases is clearly not the desire to merely have what the other has — which we shall call X — but the desire to overcome the pain of seeing the other have X.

To clarify the above point, we can distinguish envy from the case wherein the other having X is seen as an injustice; here, the pain of seeing the other have X is rooted in anger, and the desire is a desire for justice rather than envy. But note that the desire is not primarily for overcoming the anger but primarily for something positive, i.e. justice. Hence, envy is indeed rooted primarily in overcoming a negative rather than achieving a positive. A positive may be achieved through envy as a by-product, but that is not the focus.

_First, some definitions_...

**Positive**:

Something that exists and can be affirmed by knowledge and experience.

**Negative**:

The negation of something that exists and can be identified with respect to knowledge and experience of that which exists.

_Back to the discussion_...

However, note that the pursuit of values requires an orientation toward the positive as a primary, with the orientation against the negative as being at most derivative to the orientation toward the positive. Why? Because metaphysically, nothing is not something, i.e. the absence of a negation of a thing does not imply the existence of the thing; there may be nothing in reality negating the existence of a party of gremlins on Pluto, but the absence of its negation does not imply its existence. By extension, value (i.e. something) is not primarily the negation of its absence (i.e. nothing). To go further, the standard of value, i.e. life, is the affirmation of existence, which means it is not and cannot primarily be the denial of nothingness, since there is no such thing as "nothingness" and hence there is nothing in it to deny; there is only existence and its affirmation. In other words, life is not primarily the avoidance of death.

To make it clearer, consider: what does it mean to avoid or reject the negative? In concrete terms, it may be: running away from a predator, protecting your eyes from dust in the air, not investing in a volatile stock, etc. In every case, you protect something that exists, which means the avoidance or rejection of the negative, i.e. the threat or liability or harm, presupposes a positive, i.e. a potential or asset or benefit. In other words, an orientation against the negative presupposes an orientation toward the positive.

Now, consider the basis of envy, namely the orientation against the "negative" that is the emotional pain caused by another's possession or achievement. If it is indeed a negative, then does it threaten or harm the values you hold? If it does, then your primary orientation is to protect what you have rather than covet diminish or destroy what you do not. But such an orientation is not envy. Hence, if the negative part of envy is justified, then identifying it would dissolve the envy.

Furthermore, consider the "desire" aspect of envy. A desire is valid only if it is based on the facts of reality. If the desire for what another has — which we shall call X — is based on the recognition of value, then the pain of the other having X is invalid if X is achievable to you. If X is not achievable to you in the given context, then it cannot be a value in that context, because only what is possible can be a value. Why? Because acting to gain and/or keep what you cannot gain and/or keep is irrational and, needless ot say, impossible. In other words, something you cannot act to gain and/or keep in the given context cannot be a value in the given context.

Furthermore, a key fact of reality for value-seeking being is that the values of the being are always integrated with respect to a given context (see: ["Integrity of values" from _The Nature of Value_ from **Ethics**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html#integrity-of-values)). If achieving X violates your values in the given context, then X cannot be a value, since the pursuit of X cannot integrate with the values you actually hold in the given context. In such a case, the desire for X is invalid.

Hence, we observe that when we grasp our context of the facts and values, then envy dissolves into more constructive emotions and motivations. Hence, I posit that envy is an emotion that reveals one's lack of contextual clarity; gaining the clarity is key to orienting yourself toward values and against irrational and potentially self-destructive goals.

## Jealousy: An out-of-context view of potential and threat
Jealousy is similar to envy, except that instead of dealing with values and their loss, it deals with potential values and threats (i.e. potential loss) to potential values. The reasoning for the invalidity of jealousy is similar in essence; jealousy is rooted in the desire to overcome a feeling a threat rather than the desire to pursue a potential.
