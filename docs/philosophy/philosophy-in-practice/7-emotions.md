# Introduction
In my understanding, emotions are an automatic psychological response to the gain or loss of values or potential values (note that psychological means based on the subconscious mind, i.e. based on internalised premises). The pleasure-pain mechanism is the basic physiological counterpart of emotions, where we experience physical sensations, i.e. automatic physical responses to the gain or loss of values or potential values.
