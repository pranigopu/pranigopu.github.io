# Introduction
To sustain itself, the life of a volitional being requires the integration of the actual and the potential, i.e. it requires a long-range orientation (see: [_The Nature of Life_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-life.html)). Consequently, the pursuit of values is done with respect to an integrated hierarchy of values, wherein each level of the hierarchy has a whole context of interrelated values (see: [_The Nature of Value_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html)). Hence, we see that the integration of the actual and the potential is a key aspect of applying ethics in particular and philosophy in general.


As a further motivation, note that in general, the greater the value (i.e. the more essential the value for life as a whole), the harder it is to gain and/or keep it. Why? Because the greater the value, the more it integrates on every level of one's life, which means its pursuit involves greater cognitive and practical complexity. Hence, in general, integrating the actual and the potential to achieve one's greatest values (and ultimately one's value for life as a whole) is not an easy task and requires strong understanding, principles and practice.


# The acceptance of reality
The acceptance of reality, i.e. the conscious affirmation of the facts of reality is the basis for rationality and thus for morality. Never place an "I wish" over an "it is", since doing so means turning away from the real in favour of the unreal, i.e. that which you neither have nor seek knowledge about. Accept reality for all that it is so you can effectively strive toward what can be, i.e. the pursuit of value presupposes the acknowledgement of truth.


# The basis of motivation and willpower
**LEXICAL NOTE**:


Motivation is the concrete experience of the value for a particular potential. Willpower is the self-driven capacity of the volitional faculty to exert effort in a particular direction of focus. Willpower and motivation are ultimately integrated in one's pursuit of value; willpower is the volitional effort to engage in a pursuit, motivation is the fuel that makes such engagement possible, especially long-range.


---


Motivation is based on life-affirmation in the moment and the focus on the facts. The focus on the facts is an essential form of life-affirmation, since it affirms the basis of one's pursuit of life, namely the affirmation of reality. What does it really mean in practice? In practice, look at reality, look at your motives, keep the factual context in mind and then follow your motives to the fullest. In other words, do not divorce your motivation from the pursuit of values, but instead of trying to force your motivation through sheer willpower, acknowledge and accept your motives while staying in full focus of reality, i.e. of your relevant factual context. Most importantly, do not divorce the affirmation of life in the moment from the pursuit of efficacy, especially long-range. Why does it work?


The philosophical basis is clear: life is the standard of value and the ultimate value, which means it is what integrates every other value. In essence, every value is but one value, i.e. the value for one's life, applied in different ways to different contexts (see: ["Integrity of values" from _The Nature of Value_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html#integrity-of-values)). However, since concretes are the metaphysical source of any truth and thus any value, the metaphysical source of the value for life (i.e. the source as present in reality) is necessarily the concrete affirmation of one's life, i.e. the self-motivated engagement with reality in the here and now (ranging from pleasure, enjoyment, etc. to focus, such as attentive focus, productive focus, etc. to recreation, relaxation, etc. to pain, serenity, struggle, etc.). Without such affirmation, no value exists and hence no motivation can be sustained.


Consider it another way: why pursue something, short-term or long-term, if there is no purpose to it? If you gain nothing from life as you live it and thereby nothing fuels or sustains you for striving toward your life's potential, then how can you strive for any potential? Furthermore, why strive toward anything if not ultimately to affirm life in the moment? If life is not affirmed in the here and now in some form, the value for it becomes a floating abstraction and thereby loses its tie to reality. Life is the source of purpose and thereby of value, so if no affirmation of life is pursued and achieved in some form, then ultimately (1) nothing is purposeful and (2) motivation dies out.


However, why follow your motivations to the fullest while keeping one's focus on reality rather than fight against motivations toward more "constructive" or long-range pursuits? Note that by "fighting" one's motivations, I do not mean engaging in uncomfortable, difficult or even excruciating work — after all, motivation can persist even in great hardship and falter even in great comfort, so "comfort" and "pleasantness" are non-essentials in motivation (not necessarily insignificant but non-essential). Rather, by "fighting" one's motivations, I mean acting against your motives, i.e. acting against what you experience most concrete value for (e.g. emotionally, psychologically, physically, etc.). Now, consider the following points:


1.


The source of volition and therefore of willpower is one's ability to direct one's focus. Hence, ultimately, keeping one's focus on reality (which includes the factual context, one's philosophical convictions, one's hierarchy of values in a broader level, etc.) is the basic cause for the direction of one's motivation.


2.


One's volitional mechanism is finite in capacity and has a particular nature and range by which it operates; trying to operate one's volition apart from its nature or outside its range leads to motivational overload, i.e. the failure to concretely value something. When in such a state, trying to push past it by mere effort is the denial of the nature of your volitional faculty and thereby a denial of reality. To put it in other words, willpower is finite (though renewable) and not omnipotent even within one's own mind, and motivation is neither causeless nor subjective but rather based on one's internalised premises.


3.


Drawing from the second point, one's volitional mechanism can only operate when one's potential is concretised in some way and to some extent. This is because the basis of volition is long-range purpose, and the metaphysical basis of purpose is the concrete affirmation of life. To concretise potential is to concretise the values present in the pursuit of the potential; if such values do not exist, the pursuit cannot be sustained after a point.


---


Combining the above three points, we observe that fighting against one's motivations can at most be a short-range effort and cannot sustain long-range. Furthermore, relying only on one's sheer willpower to fight against "undesirable motivations" ignores the source of willpower itself, i.e. one's self-directed focus on reality and the conscious affirmation of the facts one grasps. Furthermore, it ignores the source of motivation, namely the concrete affirmation of life, i.e. the concrete experience of values, which is the metaphysical source of all values. Lastly, it is key to grasp that motivation, i.e. the concrete experience of one's value for a potential is key to the operation of one's volitional mechanism; without such concrete experience, the value for the potential remains a floating abstraction, losing its ties to reality.


Summarising the point so far into a tip, the idea is: keep your focus on reality, do not practise self-abnegation but rather engage with your motivations with full awareness and full intent, check your core premises and ultimately let your premises and your focus on reality shape your motivations and thereby fuel and sustain your capacity to pursue a certain potential (be it short-range or long-range). Note that motivation does not take away from the necessity of willpower, since motivation is the fuel and not the driver of willpower.

**NOTE 1**: You can exert your willpower against your motivations, but only up to a point. Some short-term cases may occasionally call for such a use of willpower (e.g. emergencies or short deadlines), but note that it is not sustainable to do so and, if done as a practice, will lead you to become drained and unable to apply your willpower any further and potentially even unable to experience the value for life for a while.


**NOTE 2**: The nature of motivational overload is further discussed in the section ["Motivational overload" from "Overload" from "Sources of inefficacy"](#motivational-overload).

**Observations**:


1.


In the face of a deadline that was not too close but important to address (i.e. my semester 2 final assignments in 2024), I found that consciously and completely engaging with concretely enjoyable activities — such as watching a show I enjoyed — had two advantages compared to pushing against my desires and forcing myself to work. (1) I did not drain my willpower, and thus, did not drain my motivation and capacity to engage with valuable but uncomfortable work in general. (2) I was able to properly satisfy myself (since I did not keep undermining my pleasure with shame or despair) and move past my need for concrete enjoyment, and thus, was able to focus on more challenging work more effectively, leading to far more efficient work and substantial results. I would compare this case to that of starvation; when you are starved, it is hard to think of anything but food, not least because food is an essential need that must be satisfied to fuel yourself for other pursuits. In this light, note that I do not regard concrete enjoyment — or any form of life-affirmation — as something "to get over with" or a nuisance or an itch that must be addressed, but rather, as a vital, genuine need of my mind and for my life, just as food is a genuine need of the body and not a mere indulgence.


**KEY POINT**: _The above only applies if there is no evasion on your part about what you are doing and what may be its consequences to you. Only a full and true acceptance of reality as it is can ensure that such indulgence can be of any value and pleasure (in the true sense) to you; evasion is a cause of shame and despair, and thus, destroys enjoyment and life-affirmation._


2.


When I strain myself beyond my motivations, I tend to get drained in one or more respects; cognitively, emotionally or physically. Cognitive and physical drain are easier to overcome through rest, but emotional drain indicates a psychological experience of loss in values. Even though the values involved are worth pursuing in the long-run, since the psychological aspect of motivation is what drives you, such a loss in fact drains you (at least temporarily) of the will to pursue your goals further (a good analogy would be the training of muscles). The psychological aspect can be shaped over time but often not immediately, and draining it in the short-run makes losing the context of and thus value for the long-run almost inevitable (e.g. (a) initial and intermediate stages of doing the final assignments of semester 2 in 2024, (b) December-January examination preparation in 2023-2024, wherein I lost the motivation for both job applications and studying, etc.).


# Further points on motivation


1.


Motivation has both an intellectual (abstract) and a psychological (concrete) aspect. Both are vital and must be integrated (at least over time); the abstract aspect integrates the relevant concretes and validates motivations in the right context, whereas the concrete aspect is what ultimately drives your actions. However, the concrete, i.e. psychological aspect is largely subconscious; the abstract, i.e. intellectual aspect is key in shaping the psychological aspect, but such shaping must be done logically (remember the analogy of a programmer — the intellectual aspect — and the computer — the psychological aspect). Thus, shaping your motivations may often be a matter of a more tactful, indirect approach rather than direct intent or willpower, especially in view of the complexity of your goals and of your means to achieve them.

2.


If you lack the motivation or capacity to do something in a given context, then beyond a certain point, you literally — in fact — cannot sustain its pursuit of your own volition in that context. However, this need not incapacitate you; while you may lack the motivation or capacity to do something in the given context, you can shift your focus to improve your ability (e.g. by addressing more basic existential needs, mental or physical) or pursue something else (according to what you judge to be the most important or valuable in a broader context). Note that motivation can persevere in the hardest, most severe of conditions, and it can falter even in relative comfort; in general, it is not primarily a question of "what is going on outside" but "what is going on inside" (although, of course, both questions are important and potentially relevant to each other). Why is the motivation present or absent? Ask to understand its roots: what are its essential causes, what are the relevant factors in dealing with it, etc.? Understanding this is a part of understanding reality objectively so you can deal with it effectively. It is ineffective to try to brute-force your way through your lack of motivation because the facts about your consciousness (e.g. the nature of volition, finiteness of willpower, etc.) and its relationship to reality (e.g. how emotions and motives arise, what is the nature and role of values, how can and must a mind grasp the facts effectively, etc.) will not sustain it.


# The hierarchical and contextual organisation of values
To make explicit what has been implicit so far: values, same as knowledge, are hierarchical and contextual. Hence, values, same as knowledge, must be evaluated from the most fundamental, abstract level to the most concrete level. Whether you start with abstract or concrete considerations, make sure to integrate to the point that you gain the most fundamental, abstract level view of the goal before applying this view to the more concrete levels; this allows you to pursue your values in a broader context, the broadest being of your life as a whole.
