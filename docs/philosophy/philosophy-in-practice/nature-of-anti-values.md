**_Drawing from the context set it_** [_The Nature of Value_ from **Ethics**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html)

# Introduction
A value is ultimately an aspect of life-affirmation, i.e. every value is ultimately the contextual expression of the value for life (for a volitional being, life naturally means life as volition being). For a volitional existence, life-affirmation does not exist in isolation but in integration with one's life as a whole, i.e. in integration with both the actual and the potential. Hence, values exist as a non-contradictory whole, which means the demands of life-affirmation can never conflict. If there is a conflict, it reveals falsehoods and/or contradictions in your premises.

For example, if a farmer chooses to stay a little hungry so that his seed stock is untouched, it is not the case that his value for food is in conflict with his value for his long-range agricultural productivity; instead, food that comes from his seed stock is in fact against his long-range survival and prosperity, and thus cannot be a value. As another example, if a student chooses to deny some of his immediate pleasure for the sake of his studies, it is not the case that his value for immediate pleasure is in conflict with his value for a solid grasp of his subjects within some deadline; instead, immediate pleasure that would distract him from his studies are against his integrated self-interest (i.e. his self-interest within a broader context of his life) and thus cannot be a value.

Hence, an anti-value is anything that actually contradicts one's values as a whole, either by frustrating the pursuit of one or more values or by degrading or destroying one or more values. Hence, the farmer taking some of his seed stock for food when he can afford to go a bit hungry is against the farmer's values, and such food would be an anti-value. Similarly, the student seeking some immediate pleasure so as to distract himself from his studies is against the student's values, and such pleasure would be an anti-value.

# The nature of threat

# The nature of failure
A failure is not necessarily anti-value.
