# Introduction

_First, some definitions_...

**Happiness**:

If values are defined with one's life as the standard, and if happiness is the psychological affirmation of life as an end in itself, then happiness is the state of the non-contradictory achievement of one's values. Since life in this context means life as a volitional being, life and thus happiness involve the integration of the actual and the potential, i.e. the short-range and the long-range. However, since life in this context refers to life as a whole rather than any given moment of life, happiness is the state of the non-contradictory achievement of one's values in the long-range, i.e. in one's life as a whole, with non-essential short-term losses being ultimately irrelevant to happiness.

**NOTE**: _By the nature of a volitional life, volitional life cannot be sustained without such integration, even if one chooses to live off of available resources and/or the effort of others_ (see: ["Life as a volitional being" from _The Nature of Life_ from **Ethics**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-life.html#life-as-a-volitional-being)).

**Suffering**:

With the same definition of values, if suffering is the psychological response to the undermining of one's life, suffering is the state of the frustration of one's values. Again, since life in this context means life as a volitional being, life and thus suffering involve the integration of the actual and the potential, i.e. the short-range and the long-range. However, since life in this context refers to life as a whole rather than any given moment of life, suffering is the state of the frustration of one's values in the long-range, i.e. in one's life as a whole, with non-essential short-term gains being ultimately irrelevant to suffering.

_Back to the discussion_...

If one's morality is the practical framework to pursue one's value for one's life in the broadest context available, then one's pursuit of life is defined by one's pursuit of happiness and not one's avoidance of suffering. However, the question is: what does the pursuit of happiness involve in practice? In essence, everything discussed in [**Philosophy in Practice**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/philosophy-in-practice), is part of what the pursuit of happiness involves. However, in this document, I shall look into the forms of direct, i.e. concrete experience of happiness to understand how to recognise, affirm and further pursue one's happiness in the moment.

# Key characteristics of happiness
Happiness is a state of consciousness arising from the non-contradictory achievement of values, but the state of the achievement of values is not static and does not imply any particular emotions, positive or negative. Hence, happiness is not a positive emotional state, nor does it consist only of positive emotional states. However, since happiness is a form of sustained, i.e. long-range life-affirmation, positive emotional states are a key characteristic of happiness in the long-term, but not necessarily at any given point or short-term period.

Therefore, a happy person is not the same as a joyous person, although a happy person can also be a joyous person. Joy is a powerful fuel for one's life and happiness but not the only feature of it. The same applies for enjoyment, pleasure, comfort, etc. Then, what characterises a happy person? Since happiness is a state of the non-contradictory achievement of values, the key characteristic of happiness is self-value, i.e. self-esteem. Furthermore, since purpose is a fundamental value in life and since happiness is a non-static state, happiness involves a purposeful state of existence, i.e. an active-minded and engaged state of existence. Thirdly, since rationality is the fundamental virtue in one's pursuit of life, happiness involves the wholehearted affirmation of one's grasp of reality; an evasive state of mind can never result in happiness. Lastly, since happiness is essentially a long-range state of consciousness, a key characteristic of happiness is the tendency toward experiencing values concretely, i.e. the tendency toward positive emotions, especially when compared to experiencing negative emotions.

# Happiness and emotional states
Based on the above conclusions, the essentials of happiness are self-value, engagement with reality, the affirmation of one's grasp of reality and the tendency toward the concrete experience of value; in short, pride, purpose, rationality and the tendency toward enjoyment. Hence, we can see that in the short-term, happiness is consistent with a neutral or even negative emotional state. In fact, since emotional states are the concrete responses of your mind to one's internalised value-judgement (i.e. one's judgement of the gain or loss of values), feeling a positive emotion when a neutral or negative emotion is appropriate is a sign of dysfunction and therefore does not imply happiness; if at all, it implies a lack of the capacity for happiness, at least for the time being. Hence, happiness can be consistent with the loss of short-range values that do not harm one's core efficacy in life and one's long-range achievement of values.

However, since happiness cannot be consistent with the loss of essential or long-range values, the experience of heavy loss does impact happiness. In such a state, most of the essentials (namely pride, purpose and rationality) can still be present. However, due to the significance of the loss, one's tendency inevitably shifts (at least for a while) toward the experience of negative emotions. It is key to note, however, that even in heavy loss, as long as one values one's life, one's orientation in the long-range should be toward happiness ultimately. But reaching happiness ultimately requires the affirmation of one's loss, which requires the acceptance of some form of suffering, such as grief, and the acceptance of reality, i.e. serenity. For very heavy losses, the achievement of serenity can require mourning.

# The pursuit of happiness
_Here, we also reinforce some of the previous points._

## Happiness and willpower
Happiness is an objective state of being that integrates a variety of external and internal factors. Thus, it cannot be achieved by mere willpower. Let us expand on this fact. Happiness, properly defined, is the proper goal of volitional life (see: ["Volitional life is tied to the pursuit of happiness" from _The Nature of Value_ from **Ethics**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-life.html#volitional-life-is-tied-to-the-pursuit-of-happiness)). However, happiness is a complex goal, i.e. a goal that integrates every aspect of one's life. Hence, it cannot be achieved by mere whim, wish or force of will; it needs rationality, the acceptance of reality and the objective experience of reality, i.e. the experience of both gain and loss, as appropriate.

Hence, a state of joy is not what happiness is about. Rather, happiness is the state of full and non-contradictory life-affirmation. Now, note that life-affirmation must be pursued in steps and cannot reach its full potential directly. Hence, since happiness needs objectivity in thought, action and experience, the pursuit of happiness needs the acceptance of the fact that happiness is not automatic and need not be experienced at every given moment for life to be worth sustaining. The pursuit of happiness is essential to one's life, but the experience of happiness is essential ultimately, i.e. in the long-run, not necessarily at every given point in life.

_To further reinforce the above discussion_, see: ["The capacity for value implies and needs the capacity for loss" from _The Nature of Value_ from **Ethics**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/nature-of-value.html#the-capacity-for-value-implies-and-needs-the-capacity-for-loss).

## The nature of life-affirmation in the moment
Happiness is the fullest expression of life-affirmation, which means understanding the nature of life-affirmation is relevant to understanding how to pursue happiness. Life-affirmation in the moment the _concrete_ pursuit and experience of values, which means it is the metaphysical basis for all purpose and all value. Note that the core value to be experienced is volitional life itself, i.e. life wherein one is alive, aware and desirous to be both. Hence, life-affirmation is essentially the concrete pursuit and experience of life itself.

Hence, as long as such a value exists in some concrete form, the nature of life-affirmation does not imply a need for positive emotion or enjoyment in the moment. Why? Because the concrete pursuit and experience of life requires objectivity, which also requires the acceptance of neutrality or negativity where appropriate. In fact, not accepting neutrality or negativity where appropriate is anti-life, since such a denial contradicts the facts and their relation to one's life.

Now, note that since life-affirmation in the long-term leads to the pursuit and experience of values in the long-term, the tendency and long-term effect is the experience of positivity. However, such an experience, while essential in the long-term, is non-essential for any given _concrete_ form of life-affirmation. What this means in practice is that enjoyment and pleasure in the moment are vital values but by no means the only values. Much of what is valuable may have less or even no enjoyment or pleasure in the moment, but they are still objectively and concretely valuable.

Note also that the nature of concrete motivation aligns with this view; we can feel greatly motivated for uncomfortable, difficult or sometimes even excruciating endeavours, especially endeavours that are objectively valuable to us in the long-term. Observing these facts, it is clear that life-affirmation in the moment does not always necessitate a state of enjoyment or pleasure in the moment, and expecting enjoyment or pleasure in the moment for every moment is irrational, since not every moment of every valuable pursuit leads to them or calls for them in the short-term.

I hold, however, that life-affirmation in the long-term does lead to and call for a genuine enjoyment of life in the moment as a tendency and a common practice. Furthermore, I hold that genuine enjoyment is impossible without rationality and objectivity in one's pursuits, including pursuits that do not lead to or call for enjoyment in the moment. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, I hold that life-affirmation never involves the sacrifice or renunciation of "values", be they short-term or long-term. You can and must never give up any values in the moment for the sake of "long-term values", but rather, you must understand what are in fact your values in the moment, i.e. the things that you act to gain and/or keep that integrate your pursuit of the potential with your experience of the actual; after all, a value is never a value in isolation and only in integration with every other value, all ultimately based on the value for life itself. In fact, for a volitional being, the experience of the actual never exists and never can exist apart from the recognition and pursuit of the potential in some form; the former gives rise to the latter and the latter enriches the former. To reiterate a previous point in other words, the source of value is life lived in the moment, in concrete and active engagement.
