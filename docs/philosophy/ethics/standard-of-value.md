# Goal and purpose
_First, some definitions_...

**Thing**:

That which exists. This could be an entity (i.e. that which exists as it is independent of consciousness), or an aspect of an entity (i.e. a part of the entity that is inseparable from its identity; this can be grasped by a consciousness' selective focus on the entity).

**Context**:

A context of a thing is a set of things that are related to it logically (e.g. based on similaries and differences), causally (e.g. based on actions, reactions and interactions), or both. Since any part of reality has identity and changes according to its identity, and since [multiplicity and interactivity are inherent in reality](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/metaphysics/key-metaphysical-implications.html#multiplicity-and-interactivity), every part of reality is related to one or more things both logically and causally. Furthermore, by causality, any entity acts according to its own identity and the identity of its context. For example, water boils at different temperatures based on different pressure conditions; these conditions are the context of water's boiling point. As another example, a creature tends to behave one way toward benevolent creatures (e.g. in a friendly or at least non-hostile way) and another way toward malevolent creatures (e.g. in a threatened or hostile way); here, the nature of the creatures it is interacting with is the context of its behaviour.

**Potential**:

By causality, each change is derived from the identity of the entities that change or cause the change. Thus, an entity with a certain identity in a certain context is tied to a range of changes, both present (i.e. existent) and absent (i.e. non-existent). A potential is an absent change tied to a certain entity in a certain context.

**NOTE**: _To say something will happen or can happen is to identify the relationship between a certain kind of change and a certain kind of entity within a certain kind of context. Hence, we see that potential can only be identified with respect to history, i.e. what can happen can only be identified with respect to what has happened._

_To summarise the above (credits to ChatGPT)_...

A "thing" is anything that exists, either as an independent entity or a part of one, and its context consists of related things that influence its identity and behavior; potential refers to the yet unobserved changes tied to an entity within some context, and it can be grasped through knowledge of the past actions of the entity within this context.

_More definitions_...

**Goal**:

The goal of an entity is the potential toward which the entity (1) always orients itself and acts to actualise within a set of constraints, and (2) always acts in a fundamentally self-generated way to actualise. A self-generated action of an entity is one wherein, given a set of necessary conditions for a potential that is also the set of necessary conditions for one or more other potentials, the fundamental, i.e. necessary and sufficient condition for the achievement of one potential over another is the entity's own nature and nothing else.

For example, two magnets may always orient themselves toward each other other the in right conditions, but neither magnet's action is fundamentally self-generated, because only the action of both magnets on each other is sufficient to cause the attraction, rather than the action of either one magnet with respect to the other. As another example, under gravity, water always seeks its level, but such an action is not fundamentally self-generated, because only the interaction between the force of gravity and the liquidity of water are sufficient to cause the water's level-seeking. By contrast, the growth of a tree toward sunlight is fundamentally self-generated, because given the necessary but not sufficient conditions for life (e.g. the right air composition and the availability of water and sunlight), the fundamental condition for the tree's growth is the tree's own nature as a photosynthesising life-form.

<summary><b>EPISTEMOLOGICAL NOTE ON "GOAL"</b>:<summary>
<i>The purpose of the concept of "goal" is to distinguish between a cause in a broader sense from a cause that is derived from an entity that is essentially self-driven within a set of constraints. Where does the need for such a distinction come from? I posit that it first comes from the distinction between "coincidental" and "intentional" actions or occurrences. To clarify, consider these observations: (1) Our conscious actions are always with respect to a potential that we already identify in some form and already orient ourselves toward before we pursue it. (2) We also see such actions in other conscious beings. Furthermore, (3) we observe that the pursuit of such potential is ongoing and interrelated with other such pursuits, i.e. we pursue some things for the sake of other things and ultimately for the sake of a goal that is its own goal (i.e. an end in itself). Lastly, (4) we observe that certain characteristics that separate conscious actions from natural causes, i.e. the characteristics of being self-contained, potential-oriented, interrelated and continuous until failure, are present in the characteristic actions of all living beings, not just conscious beings. These observations point to the existence of a fundamentally distinct kind of causation, i.e. final causation, i.e. goal-orientation.</i>

**Purpose, purposeful and goal-driven**:

"Purpose" can mean either "goal" or "goal-driven behaviour/orientation"; when used with an article (definite or indefinite), it means "goal" (examples of use: "the purpose of the text", "to have a purpose", "to act toward a purpose"), and when used without an article, it means "goal-driven behaviour/orientation" (examples of use: "the value of purpose", "to have purpose", "to act with purpose"). Also note that "purposeful" and "goal-driven" are synonymous. I shall use both sets of terms to avoid leaning into any connotations each set of terms may carry.

_Back to the main discussion_...

There are three kinds of goals: (1) an intermediate goal, which is a goal that is a means to another goal, (2) a self-sustaining goal, which is a goal that is an end in itself, i.e. a means to its own further achievement, and (3) a deadend goal, which is a goal that is neither a means to another goal nor an end in itself.

If a goal is an end in itself, then logically, it is a means to itself, i.e. its achievement is a necessary condition (though not necessarily a sufficient condition) for its own further achievement. Now, every entity that is goal-driven by itself must have goals that are (1) ends in themselves and (2) the basis of every other goal of the entity. Hence, a living entity is necessarily a goal-driven entity, since life is an end in itself. But can a non-living entity also be a goal-driven entity? Consider if it can.
