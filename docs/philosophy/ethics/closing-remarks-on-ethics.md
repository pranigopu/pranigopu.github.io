# The natural and the volitional
If the standard of value, i.e. life, is the standard based on the nature of our existence (in some sense), then should natural facts decide our values? Firstly, note that fundamental to our nature as human beings is our volitional faculty; to decide our values based on natural facts merely on the grounds that they are natural (i.e. pre-existing and/or with precedent in nature) is a denial of our volitional faculty. Values are decided not by whether something is "natural" (i.e. pre-existing and/or with precedent in nature) but by whether something is valuable to our existence as such; nothing in the mere fact of being "natural" makes something inherently valuable. Indeed, by experience, not everything natural, i.e. pre-existing and/or automatic, is valuable to our life; consider things like emotionalism, rejection of abstract thought, conventionalism, etc.

In short, life, truth, value and flourishing are not guaranteed by nature. Rather, we must discover what these mean by discovering how the facts confronting us relate to our choice to exist. In my view, nature-worship is immoral, since it neglects the fact that human values are not automatic, i.e. not guaranteed by nature, and must be created and/or maintained through acts of volition. Furthermore, regarding nature as the standard of good is a mistake, since the only valid standard of good is the choice to exist. Nature represents the facts of reality independent of our consciousness, but it is up to us to deal with these facts consciously and purposefully for our own ends.
