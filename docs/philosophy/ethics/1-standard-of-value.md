# Introduction
_In the introduction to ethics, we saw the need for a standard of action. Now, I shall show that the standard of action is the standard of value._

We observe that our existence is not self-contained, i.e. we need and can seek, gain and use matter from our environment to sustain our existence. Hence, we have the concept of value, i.e. that which we act to gain and/or keep. I shall argue that (1) only values give rise to the capacity for choice, (2) the only source of value is the sustenance of our existence. In this light, the standard of action is the standard of value, since how we must choose to act is shaped fundamentally by the values we must seek, gain and use. I shall also show how the nature of our existence and what it means to sustain it is shaped by the fact of volition.

# Values as fundamental to the capacity for choice
To choose is to focus one's awareness and conscious efforts on one alternative over another. If there is no reason to pick one alternative over another, such focus is essentially random or not self-driven (i.e. not based on one's own motives). Hence, an alternative — and thus volition — presupposes a goal with respect to which it can be judged and compared to other alternatives. I shall show in the next section that the basis of all goals is life, a state that gives rise to and requires the pursuit of values. In this light, we see that volition is meaningless without the standard of value (i.e. life), which means the standard of action is, fundamentally, the standard of value.

# Exploring the nature of purpose, goals, values and life
Steps taken for the exploration:

1. Differentiate purposeful entities from non-purposeful entities <br> _Hence identify the key aspects of purpose (i.e. goal)_
2. Show that goals and values are necessarily hierarchical <br> _Hence, show the need for an ultimate value_
3. Show that the fact of life is what makes goals and values possible <br> _Hence, show that life is the ultimate value and thus the standard_

Note that the process of exploration is primarily inductive, since we must reach certain concepts and generalisations about the nature of goals, values and life before we infer or deduce from them. Also, note that I treat the concepts "goal" and "purpose" synonymously; I use both so as to indicate their relationship for later sections. In general, "purpose" means "goal" or "goal-driven orientation".

## Purpose and its self-evident basis
The fact of our own consciousness is self-evident. Furthermore, our own efficacy with respect to our consciousness and conscious actions is also self-evident; we directly see the self-evident choice to stay in focus or not and the self-driven nature of our consciousness and our conscious actions. Implicit in the self-evident choice to stay in focus or not is the choice to stay in existence or not, to act for our continued existence, to act against it or to be indifferent to it. In other words, implicit in the self-evident fact of our own existence is the self-evident choice to stay in focus or not, which extends to the choice to stay in existence or not. Hence, we observe that purpose, i.e. action oriented toward a recognised potential, is a self-evident aspect of our existence that is inseparable from the very fact of our existence. Why is this important?

The importance of identifying the self-evident basis of purpose is threefold: (1) We see that the concept of purpose is not arbitrary but based on self-evident truths, which is relevant since the concept of purpose is key in grasping that human actions and the actions of living entities in general represent an essentially distinct kind of causation. (2) We see that human beings are in fact purposeful entities, which is a key observation needed to expand on the concept of purpose. Lastly, (3) purpose is essential for cognition beyond the perceptual level, i.e. concept-formation and reasoning are inherently purposeful. In other words, the very act of thinking about purpose presupposes purpose. Grasping this last point is key to grasping the fact that cognition is not arbitrary, which means concept-formation and reason are not arbitrary, i.e. they are not about mere semantics or labels but about the purposeful identification of facts of reality. Hence, we grasp that, on some level, there are self-evident truths that necessitate and validate cognition and action: the basic value for our existence, from which we get the irreducible basis and validity of purpose.

**NOTE**: _"Irreducible" here means irreducible in terms of conscious units._

## Purpose and self-generated action
Say I want to eat an apple. I act so as to find an apple. My action, in this case, was purposeful with respect to the end result as I by myself directed my action with respect to a potential end result. Now, say I do not want an apple, so I act but not to find an apple. However, by chance, I find an apple. Here, my action was not purposeful with respect to the end result; I did not by myself direct my action with respect to the end result in a self-contained potential-oriented way (i.e. I did not contain a want for a potential end result that led to my action toward that end result).

Consider a cat that wants to eat a rat. It acts so as to catch the rat. The cat's action with respect to the end result was purposeful; it by itself directed its actions with respect to a potential end result. Now, consider a cat that, by chance, stomps on a rat and thereby catches it. The cat's action with respect to the end result was not purposeful; it by itself did not direct its action with respect to the end result in a self-contained potential-oriented way (i.e. the cat did not contain a want for a potential end result that led to its action toward that end result).

Consider a rock reacting to a push and moving. There is nothing in its nature that orients itself to that end result apart from the particular factors (within and without) that led to the end result. The basic difference between the reactive action of the rock and the proactive action of a cat is thus evident; the former has no capacity to seek the end result while the latter does. Thus, the former faces no alternative with respect to any potential; it acts as it is acted upon and no way else. The latter, however, faces an alternative with respect to some potential; its action is a self-generated approach to realise that potential and it can either succeed or fail to do so.

_Hence, for a purposeful entity, the achievement of the object of its goal needs to be done and can be done by its own action, i.e. it is conditional on its own, self-generated action._

## Purpose and orientation to potentiality
Now, consider a robot programmed by a human whose goal is, say, to fetch an item back to its starting point. The robot has a goal because the program has a goal, and the program has a goal because the human who wrote it has a goal. A human can have goals, as we observe, so we can say the robot is goal-driven only as an extension of the goal-driven nature of the human who programmed it.

Now imagine that, somehow, an entity identical to the robot — programming included — was formed naturally by sheer cause-and-effect. Evidently, the robot has no goal because the program has no goal, which in turn is because nature as such does not have a goal, i.e. a self-contained potential-oriented means of action that led to an end result whose achievement is conditional on self-generated action. Instead, the chain of cause-and-effect is an integration of the interactions of many entities (external and internal), none with the capacity for goal-driven action.

**NOTE**: _One might say that, since reality is an integrated whole, reality has self-contained potential-oriented means of action. But reality exists as it is eternally, i.e. its only potential as a whole is existence itself and it does not need to act to achieve it. Hence, the concept of potential-oriented action does not apply to reality as a whole._

## Hierarchy in goals and the need for an ultimate goal
Evidently, goal-driven action must be based on the goal-driven action of purposeful entities, and such actions of such entities must also have a goal-driven basis else they are ultimately purposeless, and thus, not goal-driven to begin with. Since we cannot have an infinite regress, it stands to reason that the basis of any and every goal must be a goal that is an end in itself.

In other words, a goal is either an end in itself or a means to some other end. A goal that is neither, is a not a goal but causal coincidence in essence; we can differentiate between them (i.e. between a goal and a causal coincidence) in our own actions and the actions of other goal-driven entities like cats, and such differentiation is only possible due to some essential difference. Uncovering this difference would be the uncovering of the metaphysical basis of purpose.

## Life and propagation as candidates for ultimate goals
We observe that living beings pursue goals to ultimately either live or propagate life. Then, could life or its propagation be the ultimate value? Observe that the propagation of life presupposes life and only exists in relation to life; it is a means to further life in some form, and thus, not an end in itself (as it cannot exist independent of life metaphysically, just like an action of an entity cannot exist independent of the entity metaphysically). Note that such is the case even if reproductive processes necessarily lead to the death of the parents. However, we note that in most cases, the propagation of life does not lead to the death of the parents and often — especially in the long-run — adds value to the life of the parents (e.g. by increasing the potential for community, safety in numbers, life-expanding actions such as stronger life-oriented motivations, clearer purpose, strengthening of social bonds with other members of the species, etc.). Thus, we observe that life is an end in itself, and living entities do not live to pursue values but instead pursue values to live.

_Why the propagation of life cannot be an end in itself_...

To say that living beings live as a means to propagate life implies that the propagation of life is an end in itself. This is unfounded on three grounds: (1) It is not logically necessitated since there exist non-reproducing living beings (though often capable of reproduction), and since the propagation of life is often only a part of life and not the end of it (living beings pursue life both before and after reproductive periods). (2) It is not the overarching purpose of life, since while reproductive capability is often a part of a living being, everything about a living being is primarily oriented toward not reproduction but life. (3) The propagation of life presupposes a living being capable of pursuing life as an end in itself. This gives a lead to the objective standard of value.

**NOTE**: _The concept of life used here is broader than a strictly organic view and refers to any entity capable of self-generated, self-sustaining action._

## Indication that life is the only ultimate goal
**NOTE**: _The full proof of life as the ultimate goal (i.e. the ultimate value and the standard of value) comes in a later section. Here, I am only showing why such a position is non-arbitrary and worth considering to begin with._

While life can be a standard of value, is it the only possible standard of value? Does the concept of value have any meaning apart from life? To answer this, consider — again — the cat that wanted to eat a rat. The end result the cat achieves is that it either gets the rat (success) or does not get it (failure); as seen before, the achievement of the object of its goal is conditional on the cat's self-generated action. In the case of success, what a cat gets was implied by the cat's actions to get it; in particular the cat reacts to its hunger and acts to pursue the object it perceives that can satisfy it, which implies food. In the case of failure, the fact that the cat did not get something is reflected in the further actions and reactions of the cat (more hunger, more hunting, etc.). Hence, the goal of a cat is implied in its own nature and its own actions in a manner essentially independent from particular external causes. Hence, apart from being based on goal-driven action, a goal must also be that which is implicit in the entity's own nature and its own actions while also being reflected in the entity's reactions, all essentially independent from particular external causes.

Hence, I posit that since a goal must be implicit in the purposeful entity's own nature and its own actions (i.e. implicit in the entity's identity and its identity's expression), a goal can only exist if and when the entity's own existence is goal-driven, i.e. if and when the entity's own existence is self-generated and self-sustaining, i.e. if the entity is alive. If it is not, its very existence — and thus, its very nature — is not goal-driven, since the end results of its actions are implicit not in the entity's own existence but in causal factors that exist apart from its own existence. In short, a goal presupposes an end in itself, which can only be life fundamentally. _The use of "fundamentally" here means that any goal-driven entity's goals are ultimately the goals of a living being. Hence, the existence of robots does not subvert the nature of life as the source of purpose; a robot's goal is nothing more than the goal of the operator, programmer or creator of the robot_.

In other words, I posit that life is the only end in itself fundamentally, and thus, it is the ultimate goal, i.e. the goal of all goals. Value, which is the object of the goal that an entity strives to gain and/or keep, has meaning if and only if life is the standard of value, i.e. the ultimate value. Thus, objectively, there can be no value apart from life and there can be no value above life. The source of the concepts of goal and value is the fact of life, and it is life that is the ultimate goal and value, and thus, the standard of value.

To strengthen my position, consider: can there be a value not tied to life? What would this mean? Consider, again, the hungry cat from above. The cat values the rat in the sense that it acts to catch and eat it; it values it in the sense that it wants it for some reason. If the reason is not tied to the cat's existence but is instead another causal factor (which is hence necessarily external to its existence), the cat can have no wants (i.e. no capacity for self-contained potential-oriented actions) and thus can have no goals or values; its actions are only causal coincidences, not self-generated nor potential-oriented. Thus, the only way in which the rat can be of value to the cat is if it is of value to its very existence, i.e. its life. In this example, the connection is clear; the rat is the cat's food, and food is the way the cat sustains the biological processes that keep it alive. But I posit that the connection can be made clear — using the same model of derivation — for any value.

## Summary
If an entity's pursuit of an end result is not tied to its own existence as the end result but to external factors, the pursued end result is for a reason beyond itself (i.e. beyond its existence), i.e. its actions are a means to some other end result outside itself. If this end result were a goal, it means the entity's actions are in pursuit of a goal outside itself, which means the entity's existence is itself a means to some goal. Here, hence, the source of the goal-driven behaviour cannot be itself. Thus, goal-driven behaviour must stem from an entity in pursuit of its own existence as the end result.

# Establishing life as the source and standard of value
_We shall now try to use the above understanding and basic conclusions to form a more rigorous argument for why life is the source and standard of value. Some definitions based on the epistemological groundwork from the previous discussion_...

**Life**:

Life is self-generated, self-sustaining action. No action can exist out of context, i.e. apart from its necessary conditions, hence life also exists with respect to necessary conditions. In other words, life is possible within a set of constraints. Furthermore, within these constraints, life is the self-generated action of a living entity that necessarily results in sustaining its own existence.

**Goal**:

The goal of an entity is the self-driven pursuit of a potential within a broader self-driven pursuit toward some potential that is continuously present within a set of constraints.

---

**EPISTEMOLOGICAL NOTE ON "GOAL"**:

The purpose of the concept of "goal" is to distinguish between a cause in a broader sense from a cause that is derived from an entity that is essentially self-driven within a set of constraints. Where does the need for such a distinction come from? I posit that it first comes from the distinction between "coincidental" and "intentional" actions or occurrences. To clarify, consider these observations: (1) Our conscious actions are always with respect to a potential that we already identify in some form and already orient ourselves toward before we pursue it. (2) We also see such actions in other conscious beings. Furthermore, (3) we observe that the pursuit of such potential is ongoing and interrelated with other such pursuits, i.e. we pursue some things for the sake of other things and ultimately for the sake of a goal that is its own goal (i.e. an end in itself). Lastly, (4) we observe that certain characteristics that separate conscious actions from natural causes, i.e. the characteristics of being self-contained, potential-oriented, interrelated and continuous until failure, are present in the characteristic actions of all living beings, not just conscious beings. These observations point to the existence of a fundamentally distinct kind of causation, i.e. final causation, i.e. goal-orientation.

---

**Value**:

Value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. It is, in essence, the achievable object of a goal (achievability is key, since objectively, one cannot act to gain and/or keep anything if the facts of reality make it impossible as such).

---

_Back to the discussion. Note that though the following discussion is primarily deductive, such deduction was only made possible by the induction performed previously to arrive at the necessary concepts of purpose, goals, values and life and the broad, essential nature of each_...

## The hierarchical nature of goals
A goal — like any action, state or potential — is a goal of an entity. If the entity pursues a goal only for the sake of achieving it once and not as a means to pursue further goals, then the end result is not part of a goal ultimately. In other words, there would be no answer, ultimately, for why the goal is pursued, i.e. the actions of the entity are essentially — i.e. at their core or ultimately — not goal-driven. Hence, a goal is necessarily either a means to another goal or an end in itself. Hence, the goals of any goal-driven entity are hierarchical in nature.

## The nature of a goal that is an end in itself
If a goal is an end in itself, then logically, it is a means to itself, i.e. its achievement is a necessary condition (though not necessarily a sufficient condition) for its own further achievement. Now, every entity that is goal-driven by itself must have goals that are ends in themselves and are the basis of every other goal of the entity. Hence, a living entity is necessarily a goal-driven entity, since life is an end in itself. But can a non-living entity also be a goal-driven entity? Consider if it can.

Let X be a non-living entity with some goal G that is an end in itself. Then, given the other necessary conditions, achieving G is a sufficient condition for further achieving G. Hence, given the other necessary conditions, achieving G sustains the existence of X so that it further achieves G. In other words, since X produces self-generated action to pursue G and since the pursuit of G sustains itself — given the other necessary conditions — we have that X is an entity capable of and oriented toward self-generated, self-sustaining action. In other words, X is alive. Hence, we have that every goal-driven entity is a living entity and vice versa.

## Life as the only end in itself
We see that life is an end in itself, but is life the only end in itself? Consider the nature of a goal that is an end in itself. If any entity has such a goal, then necessarily, the pursuit of the goal sustains the entity's own existence, given the other necessary conditions. In other words, such a goal is necessarily a self-sustaining goal, i.e. a goal that — given the other necessary conditions — sustains the existence of the entity pursuing it. But this is exactly what life is: self-generated, self-sustaining action. In other words, an end in itself is indistinguishable from life, i.e. it has to be life in some form. Hence, life is indeed the only end in itself.

## Expanding on the basic nature of life
As defined previously, life is the self-generated, self-sustaining action of an entity. Now, observe that the concept of "self-sustaining action" implies a need; if there were no need, self-sustenance would be inapplicable since the entity's existence would not depend on the entity's own actions. Furthermore, a need implies that the entity seeks something apart from its current state (e.g. potential internal states, potential external conditions, material from the environment, etc.). Hence, for the sake of clarity, we can further describe life as the self-generated, self-sustaining action of an entity seeking, gaining and using something apart from its current state to sustain itself further. In other words, a living entity is an entity that (1) needs something apart from its current state to sustain itself further, and (2) seeks, gains and uses it to do so. In other words, the fact of life is what gives rise to values and makes their pursuit necessary. Since life itself is a value and since it gives rise to every other value, the goal-driven actions of the goal-driven entity are essentially the pursuit of values.

---

**CLARIFICATION**:

- Self-generated ⇒ Primary cause of interaction is its own action
- Self-sustaining ⇒ Effect of action is the sustenance of the capacity for the action

---

Self-generation separates a living entity from an entity that interacts with its environment to be what it is in such a way that none of the actions (neither from the entity itself nor from the environment) are primary causes (i.e. none precede the other). Hence, a living entity is different from, say, a body of water (whose existence is sustained by certain conditions and thus certain kinds of interactions with its environment, such as the pressure, movement and temperature of air) or a tornado (whose existence is inseparable from specific wind and dust movements in the environment).

Self-sustenance separates a living entity from an entity that may have self-generated action but has no need or means of furthering its own existence. Hence, a living entity is different from, say, a machine or an atom. A living being, thus, is the only kind of entity that faces an alternative with respect to its existence; a non-living thing faces no such alternative either because its existence is unconditional or because it has no means of furthering its existence (hence, the question of alternative does not arise with respect to its own self-generated actions).

## Summary
A living being is the only kind of entity that can hold a goal that is an end in itself, and hence, it is the only kind of entity that can be goal-driven fundamentally. Of course, there can be entities that pursue the goals set by a goal-driven entity; such other entities (e.g. machines, programs, automatons, etc.) may be considered "goal-driven" in the derivative sense, i.e. in the sense that they have goals that are ultimately derived from goal-driven entities. However, even such entities presuppose an entity that actually has an end in itself, i.e. an entity that is actually alive. The last key point is that life is the only end in itself, the ultimate value, and thus, the basis of every other goal and value.

**EPISTEMOLOGICAL MISTAKES IN PROVING LIFE AS THE STANDARD OF VALUE**:

This is an important epistemological discussion on the potential conceptual and logical mistakes that must be avoided in any proof, with the proof of life as the standard of value taken as the case study. Check the discussion [here](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/epistemological-mistakes-in-proving-life-as-the-standard-of-value.html).

# The value of life as an expression of reality's absolutes
Metaphysically, reality is the absolute. Epistemologically, reason is the absolute. With reality and reason as our context, we observe that the question of how to act only comes up if we can act and have a reason to act, i.e. if we can have and pursue values. A value is the basis of self-generated cause as opposed to causal coincidence. As we have seen, the objective source of value is life, which is — by its nature — the ultimate value, and thus, the standard of value.

In essence, the value of life is the affirmation of existence. Existence has no alternative; non-existence is not a separate realm of values competing with existence. The question, "Why to affirm existence?" is invalid as there is nothing to affirm — fundamentally — but existence. To reject life as the standard of value is to reject existence as such and thus reject values as such, to pursue the non-existent, the unreal — the zero. We may choose to end our existence or place our existence at risk, and there may (in many cases) be good reasons to do so (as we shall see later). But to reject life as the standard is to have and pursue no values ultimately. It is either-or; either life as the ultimate value or self-destruction as the ultimate end (which, incidentally, you can never reach since you will cease to exist before you do).

# Life as a volitional being
_First, some definitions_...

**Potential**:

The end or possible ends of given causes (causes can be, for example, a given set of entities with given identities in given conditions).

**Primary cause**:

If X is the primary cause for Y, then X is the cause of all causes that cause Y. Note that to be based on something is to be caused by something, hence if Y is primarily based on X, then X is the primary cause for Y.

**Primary potential**:

If X is the primary potential of Y, then the primary causes of the identity of Y lead to X, given that the conditions support the existence of Y.

---

_Back to the discussion_...

Observe that a living being needs values it does not already have to sustain its existence, but it is also capable of seeking, gaining and using it to do so, given that (1) the conditions support its existence, and (2) the conditions support its pursuit of values (e.g. it has the capacity to change its own attributes to achieve the desired internal state, it has the capacity to change its environment to achieve the desired external conditions, the environment has the material it needs to further its existence, etc.). For a living being, hence, the primary potential offered by reality itself is its own existence.

A conscious being is a being that needs to perceive existence to sustain itself. To perceive is to retain specific interactions with the environment and use what is retained to act to realise a specific potential. For a conscious being, the primary potential offered by reality itself is its own existence; hence, a conscious being needs to perceive to act to sustain itself and is capable of doing so. In other words, a conscious being is a living being that can and must perceive reality.

Given that volition presupposes consciousness, a volitional being is a conscious being capable of self-determination. As with any conscious being, the primary potential offered by reality itself is its own existence, but being self-determined means a volitional being can choose to realise it or not. But being its primary potential, its own existence is its primary choice, i.e. the choice before every other choice. By its nature, if it is capable of sustaining its existence, then it can only have and pursue values if it chooses its existence; its recognition of its capacity to realise its primary potential is its reason to choose existence and the only reality-based, value-forming choice it can make.

It is key to note that what existence (and thus "life") means to a conscious being is predicated on its nature as a conscious being; to exist as it is, it must be able sustain its conscious existence. Similarly, what existence (and thus "life") means to a volitional being is predicated on its nature as a volitional, i.e. self-determined being; to exist as it is, it must be able to sustain its volitional, i.e. self-determined, self-motivated existence. In other words, a volitional being can only sustain its life if it finds its life worth sustaining, i.e. if it finds itself to be capable of existing as it is (i.e. as a volitional being) not only in the actual but also in the potential (potential is key, because — as seen in the previous paragraph — its reason for choosing existence is its recognition of its capacity to realise the primary potential given by reality).

_Actuality and potentiality are integrated by volition_...

Reality is not unknowable but unknown; even when we understand a lot about reality, we know that we do not know it all. Most importantly, we know that to understand and deal with reality as it is, we must understand and deal with facts beyond the actual, observed aspects of reality. It stands to reason, then, that to deal with the actual most effectively (in principle) is to grasp the potential. Hence, valuing the potential is not separate from valuing the actual, but a form of valuing the actual even further, in a broader context. Just as the potential is nothing, i.e. loses value when we give up the actual, so does the actual lose its value (in fact and not just in feeling) when we give up the potential.

_Additional point_...

For someone to say they "live for X" is a misunderstanding. In fact, they pursue X to live because, in their context, X is what enables them to pursue life volitionally. By the nature of life, values cannot exist unless life is the ultimate value, and life cannot be a means to some other value.

# Further discussion on life and value
## "Gaining" an absence or a negative
When we talk of gaining values, one may use the word "gain" in the sense of achieving the absence of a value. To avoid such ambiguity, I clarify my use of the word "gain" as follows — to gain is to gain something as opposed to nothing, and thus, you can gain only values, not their absence. For this reason, you cannot gain the negation of a value, because such a negation is based on reaching the absence of the value. This is why things like "death" or "self-destruction" cannot be "gained", because these are either the absence of values or based on reaching the absence of values (hence baseless in terms of values). Achieving death or self-destruction can be goals, but death and self-destruction themselves cannot be values, since no living entity can achieve them; any entity acting to achieve them ceases to exist before it can.

## The good as the standard of evaluation
**_Draws from the above subsection_**

**NOTE**: _"Evaluation" can also refer to emotions._

Our grasp of good is, in essence, our grasp of value. Since value can only be _ultimately_ defined positively (i.e. with respect to what is achieved rather than lost), and since anti-values can only exist in relation to values as negations of values, it stands to reason that only our grasp of the good can help us grasp the bad and the evil. To elaborate in another direction, if we define happiness as the non-contradictory achievement of values, it is not the happiness that is relative to privation but privation that is relative to happiness. The good (and, by extension, happiness) is the primary standard of evaluation. To put the point emphatically, it is not the good but the bad or evil that is relative; the good is the basis in relation to which the bad or the evil is grasped. By extension, it is not happiness but suffering that is relative; happiness is the basis in relation to which suffering is grasped.

## Matter and spirit
As we have seen, a human is a being of integrated spirit (i.e. consciousness) and matter (i.e. the physical apparatus of his mind and rightful body) — note that both are of one reality and are integrated as an inseparable whole. Therefore, the pursuit of values is both spiritual (i.e. pertaining to one's consciousness) and material (i.e. pertaining to one's physical apparatus and rightful body).

Furthermore, since spirit is integrated with matter (in the context of the self), spiritual and material values are also necessarily integrated. Hence, the pursuit of each is linked with the other; a material value, in the right context, is a spiritual value, and vice versa. For example, the pursuit of material wealth, in the context of achieving a flourishing existence with an honest view of reality, is a spiritual value that adds to your self-esteem, independence and ability to experience life. As another example, the pursuit of knowledge, in the context of knowing the nature of reality, is a material value that enables you to deal with the material in nature effectively.

_The goals of spirit and matter differ only in initial focus, not in final effect._

_More on intellectual and psychological aspects of spiritual values_...

A volitional consciousness is a self-initiated, self-sustaining and self-advancing experience, just as life is a self-initiated, self-sustaining and self-advancing motion. To sustain one's mind, one must act to maintain, improve and expand one's ability to choose, experience the results of one's choices and adhere to reality both intellectually and psychologically. The intellectual is the volitional process of cognition. The psychological is the non-volitional (potentially indirectly volitional) result of one's experience of life, the instantaneous evaluation of one's own existence. Without the intellectual, we cannot know and choose with knowledge. Without the psychological, we cannot experience and thereby concretise our own internalised values, motivations and judgements.
