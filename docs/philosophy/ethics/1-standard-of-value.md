# Setting the context
What is, is, and what is not, is not. Thus, existence exists, and that which is, is what it is. Existence is the truth of all truths, and thus, the truth underlying existence must underlie all truths, namely that which is, is what it is, i.e. the law of identity, which can also be stated as "A is A". From this law, we derive the law of non-contradiction (i.e. "A cannot be non-A at the same time and in the same respect") and the law of causality (i.e. what an entity does is an extension of what it is).

<details><summary><i>More on the aforementioned derivations</i></summary>If A is A, then A cannot be its negation at the same time and in the same respect, for then, it would not be A. Thus, we get the first corollary of the law of identity, namely the law of non-contradiction. Now, note that an action is always an action of an entity. Thus, an action can never exist apart from the entity, and since nothing exists apart from its identity, an action can also never exist apart from the entity's identity. Lastly, by the law of non-contradiction, an action can also never exist in contradiction to the entity's identity. Thus, we have the law of action, namely that what an entity does is an extension of what it is, i.e. the law of causality.</details>

Now, the senses give us what is of and from existence, and by their nature, they can give us nothing else. But the senses grasp only _that_ something is, not _what_ it is; what it is, is up to our mind to grasp. Evidently, to put our mind to the task of grasping the truth, we cannot but start with the law of identity, and we can never deviate from it lest we deviate from the pursuit of truth. Thus, we have the law underlying the pursuit of truth, namely that reason — the faculty of identifying and integrating the material given by our senses — is our only means of pursuing the truth, and logic — the art of non-contradictory identification — is the only means of pursuing the use of reason.

Now, consider the nature of a human being at its most essential. The fact that his mind is tied to his body means that the actions of his mind are tied to those of his body, and by observation, we see that this tie is often direct. The fact that he is self-aware means his consciousness is a key factor in the actions of his mind, and thus, the actions of his body, because after all, what an entity does is an extension of what it is, and a human being's consciousness is fundamentally self-aware. Thus, his consciousness, and thus much of his actions (mental and physical), are fundamentally self-driven and self-determined, i.e. in the chain of cause and effect that lead to his actions, he himself is an essential cause. In other words, a human being has free will, which is not the ability to do as whim demands, but the ability to do one thing instead of another _consciously_.

Thus, the context is as follows:

- Existence
- Identity
- Reason
- Free will

**NOTE**: _Logically, reason and free will are inseparable, since the ability to pursue the truth presupposes the ability to focus consistently and thus consciously on the truth as opposed to the false or the arbitrary. In other words, there can be no reason without free will, and since the basis of free will is the ability to direct one's focus, the fullest exercise of free will is the exercise of reason._

# The source of purpose
This is our context so far. With this context in mind, let us look upon ourselves. Do we act only as acted upon? No, we also act in a way that orients us toward a consciously identified potential, perhaps adapting to how we are acted upon but always orienting ourselves toward something in particular. Furthermore, we also push ourselves to act toward the consciously identified potential without needing to be acted upon at every step. In other words, we are not only reactive but also consciously proactive.

What if there were no consciously identified potential to act toward? Then, we can have no conscious orientation, since there is nothing to consciously orient ourselves toward. Even if we push ourselves to act, it would be toward nothing in particular, which means it would be toward nothing; this also means our focus would be toward nothing. In other words, we would exist without the exerise of focus, and hence, without the exercise of consciousness, and hence, without the exercise of anything that can sustain our existence as conscious beings. If we have not already become a vegetable or a corpse, we would soon become one, unless, of course, we turn toward some potential and act.

Hence, we see that to act toward a consciously identified potential is essential to our existence as conscious beings. Here, we can generalise: to act toward a potential is essential to life as such, conscious or not. Why? Consider: if a life-form orients itself toward nothing in particular, i.e. toward nothing, then it also does not orient itself toward its own existence (which is something in particular); at this point, if it is not already dead, it soon would be. Hence, we see that conscious existence is an extension and expansion of life, such that a key requirement for staying in existence is not just the orientation toward potential but toward conscious;y identified potential.

Now, can there not be orientation toward potential that is not tied to sustaining one's existence? Indeed, within some context, anything that acts always acts toward some potential; e.g. water under gravity always seeks its level, fluids always move from high pressure regions to low pressure regions, celestial bodies always act and interact according to the forces of gravity, etc. But when an entity's orientation is not tied to sustaining its existence, its actions are not based on what its existence demands. Such an entity cannot be alive, since a living thing that does not act based on what its life demands is but a non-living thing. Evidently, if such an entity is conscious, then it does not strive be conscious and thus stays in consciousness only by chance or support.

Now, what if such an entity strove to be conscious only in order to achieve some end? Then, barring accidents, it would be alive and conscious until it achieved its end. To such an entity, its own existence is a means to some other end. Evidently, this end cannot be based on the demands of its existence, which means it also cannot be based on its conscious grasp of existence. Why? Because to have a conscious grasp of existence is to grasp that existence is all there is, that its experience of existence is all there is for it, and that any end beyond its own existence has no basis in its experience of existence and thus has no basis in its grasp of existence.

Hence, the end pursued by such an entity cannot be based on any regard for truth, which means it is arbitrary. This also means it is unchosen, since it is detached from the entity's conscious grasp of existence and hence detached from the entity's self-driven focus, i.e. detached from the entity's reason and choice. Hence, the entity either is an automaton or has abandoned reason and reality, in which case its pursuit is for nothing (i.e. nothing of real effect to itself).

To conclude, only if an entity strives to sustain its own existence can it be alive, and an entity that is alive and conscious has only one potential that is aligned with reason and reality: its own conscious existence. Thus, we see that life, whatever its form, is an end in itself, i.e. it is its own justification. The question, "What is the meaning of life?" is as senseless as it is vague; life is its own meaning. Similarly, the assertion that, "Life is meaningless," is meaningless; life is the source of meaning as it is the only possible affirmation of reality and all its potential, and there can be no meaning apart from or "beyond" life. Having said this, we must raise a valuable question: what does it mean to strive to sustain one's conscious existence? What does this pursuit consist of, and what does it demand? These questions shall now be explored.
