# Introduction
_In the introduction to ethics, we saw the need for a standard of action. Now, I shall show that the standard of action is the standard of value._

We observe that our existence is not self-contained, i.e. we need and can seek, gain and use matter from our environment to sustain our existence. Hence, we have the concept of value, i.e. that which we act to gain and/or keep. I shall argue that (1) only values give rise to the capacity for choice, (2) the only source of value is the sustenance of our existence. In this light, the standard of action is the standard of value, since how we must choose to act is shaped fundamentally by the values we must seek, gain and use. I shall also show how the nature of our existence and what it means to sustain it is shaped by the fact of volition.

# Values as fundamental to the capacity for choice
To choose is to focus one’s awareness and conscious efforts on one alternative over another. If there is no reason to pick one alternative over another, such focus is essentially random or not self-driven (i.e. not based on one’s own motives). Hence, an alternative — and hence volition — presupposes a goal with respect to which it can be judged and compared to other alternatives. I shall show in the next section that the basis of all goals is life, a state that gives rise to and requires the pursuit of values. In this light, we see that volition is meaningless without the standard of value (i.e. life), which means the standard of action is, fundamentally, the standard of value.

# Exploring the nature of purpose, goals, values and life
Steps taken for the exploration:

1. Differentiate purposeful entities from non-purposeful entities <br> _Hence identify the key aspects of purpose (i.e. goal)_
2. Show that goals and values are necessarily hierarchical <br> _Hence, show the need for an ultimate value_
3. Show that the fact of life is what makes goals and values possible <br> _Hence, show that life is the ultimate value and thus the standard_

Note that this process of exploration is not only deductive but primarily inductive, since we must reach certain concepts and generalisations about the nature of goals, values and life before we infer or deduce from them. Furthermore, note that I treat the concepts "goal" and "purpose" synonymously; I use both so as to indicate their relationship for later sections. In general, "purpose" means "goal" or "goal-driven orientation".

## Purpose and self-generated action
Say I want to eat an apple. I act so as to find an apple. My action, in this case, was purposeful with respect to the end result as I by myself directed my action with respect to a potential end result. Now, say I do not want an apple, so I act but not to find an apple. However, by chance, I find an apple. Here, my action was not purposeful with respect to the end result; I did not by myself direct my action with respect to the end result in a self-contained potential-oriented way (i.e. I did not contain a want for a potential end result that led to my action toward that end result).

Consider a cat that wants to eat a rat. It acts so as to catch the rat. The cat’s action with respect to the end result was purposeful; it by itself directed its actions with respect to a potential end result. Now, consider a cat that, by chance, stomps on a rat and thereby catches it. The cat’s action with respect to the end result was not purposeful; it by itself did not direct its action with respect to the end result in a self-contained potential-oriented way (i.e. the cat did not contain a want for a potential end result that led to its action toward that end result).

Consider a rock reacting to a push and moving. There is nothing in its nature that orients itself to that end result apart from the particular factors (within and without) that led to the end result. The basic difference between the reactive action of the rock and the proactive action of a cat is thus evident; the former has no capacity to seek the end result while the latter does. Thus, the former faces no alternative with respect to any potential; it acts as it is acted upon and no way else. The latter, however, faces an alternative with respect to some potential; its action is a self-generated approach to realise that potential and it can either succeed or fail to do so.

_Hence, for a purposeful entity, the achievement of the object of its goal needs to be done and can be done by its own action, i.e. it is conditional on its own, self-generated action._

## Purpose and orientation to potentiality
Now, consider a robot programmed by a human whose goal is, say, to fetch an item back to its starting point. The robot has a goal because the program has a goal, and the program has a goal because the human who wrote it has a goal. A human can have goals, as we observe, so we can say the robot is goal-driven only as an extension of the goal-driven nature of the human who programmed it.

Now imagine that, somehow, an entity identical to the robot — programming included — was formed naturally by sheer cause-and-effect. Evidently, the robot has no goal because the program has no goal, which in turn is because nature as such does not have a goal, i.e. a self-contained potential-oriented means of action that led to an end result whose achievement is conditional on self-generated action. Instead, the chain of cause-and-effect is an integration of the interactions of many entities (external and internal), none with the capacity for goal-driven action.

**NOTE**: _One might say that, since reality is an integrated whole, reality has self-contained potential-oriented means of action. But reality exists as it is eternally, i.e. its only potential as a whole is existence itself and it does not need to act to achieve it. Hence, the concept of potential-oriented action does not apply to reality as a whole._

## Hierarchy in goals
Evidently, goal-driven action must be based on the goal-driven action of purposeful entities, and such actions of such entities must also have a goal-driven basis else they are ultimately purposeless, and thus, not goal-driven to begin with. Since we cannot have an infinite regress, it stands to reason that the basis of any and every goal must be a goal that is an end in itself.

In other words, a goal is either an end in itself or a means to some other end. A goal that is neither, is a not a goal but causal coincidence in essence; we can differentiate between them (i.e. between a goal and a causal coincidence) in our own actions and the actions of other goal-driven entities like cats, and such differentiation is only possible due to some essential difference. Uncovering this difference would be the uncovering of the metaphysical basis of purpose.

## Life and propagation as candidates for ultimate goals
We observe that living beings pursue goals to ultimately either live or propagate life. Then, could life or its propagation be the ultimate value? Observe that the propagation of life presupposes life and only exists in relation to life; it is a means to further life in some form, and thus, not an end in itself (as it cannot exist independent of life metaphysically, just like an action of an entity cannot exist independent of the entity metaphysically). Note that such is the case even if reproductive processes necessarily lead to the death of the parents. However, we note that in most cases, the propagation of life does not lead to the death of the parents and often — especially in the long-run — adds value to the life of the parents (ex. by increasing the potential for community, safety in numbers, life-expanding actions such as stronger life-oriented motivations, clearer purpose, strengthening of social bonds with other members of the species, etc.). Thus, we observe that life is an end in itself, and living entities do not live to pursue values but instead pursue values to live.

_Why the propagation of life cannot be an end in itself_...

To say that living beings live as a means to propagate life implies that the propagation of life is an end in itself. This is unfounded on three grounds. (1) It is not logically necessitated since there exist non-reproducing living beings (though often capable of reproduction), and since the propagation of life is often only a part of life and not the end of it (living beings pursue life both before and after reproductive periods). (2) It is not the overarching purpose of life, since while reproductive capability is often a part of a living being, everything about a living being is primarily oriented toward not reproduction but life. (3) The propagation of life presupposes a living being capable of pursuing life as an end in itself. This gives a lead to the objective standard of value.

However, while life can be a standard of value, is it the only possible standard of value? Does the concept of value have any meaning apart from life? To answer this, consider — again — the cat that wanted to eat a rat. The end result the cat achieves is that it either gets the rat (success) or does not get it (failure); as seen before, the achievement of the object of its goal is conditional on the cat’s self-generated action. In the case of success, what a cat gets was implied by the cat’s actions to get it; in particular the cat reacts to its hunger and acts to pursue the object it perceives that can satisfy it, which implies food. In the case of failure, the fact that the cat did not get something is reflected in the further actions and reactions of the cat (more hunger, more hunting, etc.). Hence, the goal of a cat is implied in its own nature and its own actions in a manner essentially independent from particular external causes. Hence, apart from being based on goal-driven action, a goal must also be that which is implicit in the entity’s own nature and its own actions while also being reflected in the entity’s reactions, all essentially independent from particular external causes.

## Life as the only ultimate goal
Hence, since a goal must be implicit in the purposeful entity’s own nature and its own actions (i.e. implicit in the entity’s identity and its identity’s expression), a goal can only exist if and when the entity’s own existence is self-generated and self-sustaining, i.e. if the entity is alive. If it is not, its very existence — and thus, its very nature — is not goal-driven, since the end result is implicit not in the entity’s own nature and self-generated actions but in causal factors that exist apart from its nature and actions. In short, a goal presupposes an end in itself, which is and can only be life fundamentally (_the use of "fundamentally" here means that any goal-driven entity’s goals are ultimately the goals of a living being. Hence, the existence of robots does not subvert the nature of life as the source of purpose; a robot’s goal is nothing more than the goal of the operator, programmer or creator of the robot_).

In other words, life is the only end in itself fundamentally (_see the comment in parantheses above_), and thus, it is the ultimate goal, i.e. the goal of all goals. Value, which is the object of the goal that an entity strives to gain and/or keep, has meaning if and only if life is the standard of value, i.e. the ultimate value. Thus, objectively, there can be no value apart from life and there can be no value above life. The source of the concepts of goal and value is the fact of life, and it is life that is the ultimate goal and value, and thus, the standard of value.

**NOTE**: _The concept of life used here is broader than a strictly organic view and refers to any entity capable of self-generated, self-sustaining action._

_Can there be a value not tied to life? What does this mean?_

Consider, again, the hungry cat from above. The cat values the rat in the sense that it acts to catch and eat it; it values it in the sense that it wants it for some reason. If the reason is not tied to the cat’s existence but is instead another causal factor (which is hence necessarily external to its existence), the cat can have no wants (i.e. no capacity for self-contained potential-oriented actions) and thus can have no goals or values; its actions are only causal coincidences, not self-generated nor potential-oriented. Thus, the only way in which the rat can be of value to the cat is if it is of value to its very existence, i.e. its life. In this example, the connection is clear; the rat is the cat’s food, and food is the way the cat sustains the biological processes that keep it alive. But the connection can be made clear — using the same model of derivation — for any value.

## Summary
If an entity’s pursuit of an end result is not tied to its own existence as the end result but to external factors, the pursued end result is for a reason beyond itself (i.e. beyond its existence), i.e. its actions are a means to some other end result outside itself. If this end result were a goal, it means the entity’s actions are in pursuit of a goal outside itself, which means the entity’s existence is itself a means to some goal. Here, hence, the source of the goal-driven behaviour cannot be itself. Thus, goal-driven behaviour must stem from an entity in pursuit of its own existence as the end result.

# Establishing life as the source and standard of value
_We shall now try to use the above understanding and basic conclusions to form a more rigorous argument for why life is the source and standard of value. Some definitions based on the epistemological groundwork from the previous discussion_...

**Life**:

Life is self-generated, self-sustaining action. No action can exist out of context, i.e. apart from its necessary conditions, hence life also exists with respect to necessary conditions. In other words, life is possible within a set of constraints. Furthermore, within these constraints, life is the self-generated action of a living entity that necessarily results in sustaining its own existence.

**Goal**:

The goal of an entity is the self-driven pursuit of a potential within a broader self-driven pursuit toward some potential that is continuously present within a set of constraints.

**EPISTEMOLOGICAL NOTE ON "GOAL"**:

The purpose of the concept of "goal" is to distinguish between a cause in a broader sense from a cause that is derived from an entity that is essentially self-driven within a set of constraints. Where does the need for such a distinction come from? I posit that it first comes from the distinction between “coincidental” and “intentional” actions or occurrences. To clarify, consider these observations: (1) Our conscious actions are always with respect to a potential that we already identify in some form and already orient ourselves toward before we pursue it. (2) We also see such actions in other conscious beings. Furthermore, (3) we observe that the pursuit of such potential is ongoing and related to each other, i.e. we pursue some things for the sake of other things and ultimately for the sake of a goal that is its own goal (i.e. an end in itself). Lastly, (4) we observe that certain characteristics that separate conscious actions from natural causes, i.e. the characteristics of being self-contained, potential-oriented, interrelated and continuous until failure, are present in the characteristic actions of all living beings, not just conscious beings. These observations point to the existence of a fundamentally distinct kind of causation, i.e. final causation, i.e. a goal-orientation.

**Value**:

Value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. It is, in essence, the achievable object of a goal (achievability is key, since objectively, one cannot act to gain and/or keep anything if the facts of reality make it impossible as such).

_Back to the discussion. Note that though the following discussion is primarily deductive, such deduction was only made possible by the induction performed previously to arrive at the necessary concepts of purpose, goals, values and life and the broad, essential nature of each_...

## The hierarchical nature of goals
A goal — like any action, state or potential — is a goal of an entity. If the entity pursues a goal only for the sake of achieving it once and not as a means to pursue further goals, then the end result is not part of a goal ultimately. In other words, there would be no answer, ultimately, for why the goal is pursued, i.e. the actions of the entity are essentially — i.e. at their core or ultimately — not goal-driven. Hence, a goal is necessarily either a means to another goal or an end in itself. Hence, the goals of any goal-driven entity are hierarchical in nature.

## The nature of a goal that is an end in itself
If a goal is an end in itself, then logically, it is a means to itself, i.e. its achievement is a necessary condition (though not necessarily a sufficient condition) for its own further achievement. Now, every entity that is goal-driven by itself must have goals that are ends in themselves and are the basis of every other goal of the entity. Hence, a living entity is necessarily a goal-driven entity, since life is an end in itself. But can a non-living entity also be a goal-driven entity? Consider if it can.

Let X be a non-living entity with some goal G that is an end in itself. Then, given the other necessary conditions, achieving G is a sufficient condition for further achieving G. Hence, given the other necessary conditions, achieving G sustains the existence of X so that it further achieves G. In other words, since X produces self-generated action to pursue G and since the pursuit of G sustains itself — given the other necessary conditions — we have that X is an entity capable and oriented toward self-generated, self-sustaining action. In other words, X is alive. Hence, we have that every goal-driven entity is a living entity and vice versa.

## Life as the only end in itself
We see that life is an end in itself, but is life the only end in itself? Consider the nature of a goal that is an end in itself. If any entity has such a goal, then necessarily, the pursuit of the goal sustains the entity;s own existence, given the other necessary conditions. In other words, such a goal is necessarily a self-sustaining goal, i.e. a goal that — given the other necessary conditions — sustains the existence of the entity pursuing it. But this is exactly what life is: self-generated, self-sustaining action. In other words, an end in itself is indistinguishable from life, i.e. it has to be life in some form. Hence, life is indeed the only end in itself.

## The nature of life as the basis for goals and values
Let us now further consider the nature of life itself. As defined previously, life is the self-generated, self-sustaining action of an entity. Now, observe that the concept of “self-sustaining action” implies a need; if there were no need, self-sustenance would be inapplicable since the entity’s existence would be unconditional (i.e. not dependent) on the entity’s own actions. Furthermore, a need implies the seeking of material from the environment; if doing so was not necessary, there would be no “need” to begin with. Hence, for the sake of clarity, we can further describe life as the self-generated, self-sustaining action of an entity seeking, gaining and using material from its environment to sustain itself further. In other words, a living entity is an entity that (1) needs material from its environment to sustain itself further, and (2) seeks, gains and uses it to do so. In other words, the fact of life makes values possible and necessary, which means the goal-driven actions of the goal-driven entity are essentially the pursuit of values.

## Summary
A living being is the only kind of entity that can hold a goal that is an end in itself, and hence, it is the only kind of entity that can be goal-driven fundamentally. Of course, there can be entities that pursue the goals set by a goal-driven entity; such other entities (e.g. machines, programs, automatons, etc.) may be considered “goal-driven” in the derivative sense, i.e. in the sense that they have goals that are ultimately derived from goal-driven entities. However, even such entities presuppose an entity that actually has an end in itself, i.e. an entity that is actually alive. The last key point is that life is the only end in itself, the ultimate value, and thus, the basis of every other goal and value.
