# Terms
## User-interface (UI)
The medium through which a user communicates with a software application.

## Role-playing game (RPG)
A game that involves the player assuming a fictional role in an in-game story.

## Roguelike
An umbrella term that encompasses games that use specific mechanics modeled after _Rogue_, a game which became famous in the 1980s. In essence, a roguelike is a game structured around failing and restarting, in which no two play-throughs are exactly alike due to a design that randomizes various aspects of the experience, according to Greg Kasavin [(Perry, 2023)](#perry-2023). More precisely, according to the Berlin Interpretation (which is the definition that was settled on by at the 2008 International Roguelike Development Conference), a roguelike must have the following [(Lee, 2021)](#lee-2021):

- Permadeath (i.e. in-game death restarts the whole run)
- Random environment generation
- Exploration and discovery
- Turn-based movement on a grid
- Non-modal gameplay
- Hack-n-slash (e.g. fighting at least some enemies is essential)
- Resource management (e.g. inventory)

**NOTE 1**: Random environment generation does not necessarily mean randomised; it can be another form of procedural generation that is practically random for the player. Furthermore, "environment generation" does not necessarily mean that the map of the game is generated anew; the environment also involves encounters, NPC interactions, loot, etc., and if one or more of these are randomised in some way, it still counts as "random environment generation".

**NOTE 2**: Non-modal gameplay is when the rules remain consistent throughout the game, with no separate “modes” for different activities. In other words, all actions and scenes take place in the same UI, which means there are no cutscenes or separate gamemodes; for example, there are no separate UIs for battles and exploration. [(Bellow, 2024)](#bellow-2024).

# Occidental Heroes
_Occidental Heroes_ is a roguelike RPG with exploration, quests and turn-based tactical combat but without non-modal gameplay (i.e. battles, exploration and city/town stops have separate UIs). My goal here is to present lessons I learned from playing the game that apply to life more broadly. However, to put these lessons in the context of the game, I shall first briefly explain the game.

## About the game
The game starts by choosing a founder for an adventuring company, wherein you can choose one out of many specialisations (e.g. man-in-arms, fencer, archer, etc.) and backstories (e.g. impoverished nobleman, devout warrior monk, etc.); each specialisation comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, and each backstory comes with its own special capabilities and personal goal. Normally, you can choose up to two party members with pre-defined specialisations and backstories; the options are randomised at the start of every run. The goal of the game is to help each party member achieve their personal goal and earn enough money to retire comfortably.

Money is earned mostly by completing dangerous jobs, but there are also rewards (in money, loot or other kinds) that can be won through battles or earned by completing side-quests. Each party member has his own personal goal that has its own criteria for success. Furtermore, each party member also has a level resolve, which can decrease (e.g. if wounded in battle) or increase (e.g. by winning a battle without the party taking any hits). Taking care of resolve is important since a party member quits the company if his the resolve is too low.

The game is set in a low-fantasy medieval world, and the events of the game take place in the "Occident", a newly colonised contintent with its own natives and native history (like the Americas in our world). The map consists of a number of terrains (e.g. plains, hills, forests, etc.) with a number of settlements and structures (e.g. cities, towns, ruins, etc.) spread across the map. The map is set in a grid, and as the party travels across the map, it may be faced with random encounters (e.g. merchants, bandits, etc.). Jobs can be sought in most settlements, and party members can be retired in taverns in the settlements that have them. If the party is short of members (due to retirement or death), new party members may also be sought in such taverns.

Retiring a party member makes sure the member leaves the company in good terms (which improves the company's reputation), unlike if the member quits due to low resolve. Furthermore, if a member has achieved his goal and/or achieved enough money to retire comfortably, he contributes to the player's score even if retires, but not if killed (if killed, only his money is taken into account for the score). Hence, seeking new party members and helping them achieve their personal goals and earn enough money to retire comforably is important to the score, and the highest score possible is 100%.

## Lessons learned
### 1. Perspective on losing values
Do not let the loss of a value blind you from other values in your life.

### 2. Perspective on reality and fortune
Reality and fate/fortune owe you nothing.

### 3. Perspective on gain
Take what you want and pay for it.

### 4. Perspective on regret
Hold onto regret only until you learn from or correct for your errors and/or faults to the best of your capacity and knowledge. Self-punishment (and regret) must never be ends in themselves but means to improving one's efficacy in life; to the extent that it does not serve to improve one's efficacy in life, it must be put aside.
