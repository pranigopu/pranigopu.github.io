# God as the prime mover?
In the fundamentals of metaphysics, we have established that the fact of existence and the laws of reality necessitated by this fact supersede all else by the very nature of existence. We also established the primacy of existence, but I aim to reinforce this truth with a dialogue.

- If everything is random, then reason is random; hence there is no reason, hence there is no causality or even identity. Thus, there must be a prime mover — God — that is the source of reason.
- The fact of existence necessitates identity, and identity necessitates causality. Even if a consciousness of the likes of God were to exist, it could exist only as a part of existence, bound by the same fundamental laws as everything else.
- But why are things the way they are? Why do similarities and differences between things exist? Why is there a multitude of identities and not just one? Is this state of existence not arbitrary?
- By the nature of existence and its laws, the state of existence as it is cannot be arbitrary; everything that is, is because of its nature or some cause that made it what it is. However, metaphysics abstracts from the specifics of the state of existence and focuses on the overarching (hence broader) truths necessitated by the fact of existence. Thus, understanding the root of the specific state of existence is the domain of a special science, namely physics. Pursuing this understanding is non-trivial and requires careful knowledge-seeking.
- Why cannot consciousness be the source of everything that exists? Why is existence primary? Why cannot existence be consciousness — such as the eternal consciousness of God as given in some belief-systems?
- Awareness, by its nature, needs an object; this was established in the fundamentals of metaphysics. Hence, will — which is borne of awareness — needs existence to exist before it can exert itself on that which exists.
- Your definition of consciousness as the faculty of awareness is arbitrary. What if consciousness existed beyond awareness?
- But will requires awareness. Even if you were to redefine consciousness such that awareness was not fundamental to it, awareness is still fundamental to will. In essence, you would be arguing that something beyond awareness had to exist before awareness was aware of it; the same truth as the one we established in the fundamentals of metaphysics, only in altered words that are nevertheless assigned as a whole to equivalent concepts.
- But what if awareness was at the source of the identities we see around us?
- Awareness cannot be the source of existence as such, but it could — perhaps in some form and through some means — be the source of a great many things; this is up to the special sciences to uncover, as it pertains to the specific state of existence.

# Does the part need to reflect the whole?
Any part of reality has an identity and acts according to it, which means it exists in some logical and causal relationship to the rest of reality. Hence, any part of existence naturally reflects its relationship to the rest of existence in some form. However, a one-to-one correspondence is in no way necessitated. A creature having eyes does not mean the planet it lives on must have the power of vision, and a person having a mind does not mean the universe must be based on a mind itself. On the contrary, we observe that since everything that exists is necessarily something distinct in at least some respects, a one-to-one correspondence is never guaranteed on every level. Nonetheless, the parts do reflect the whole in some way: for example, the creature's existence does reflect a lot about its planet, e.g. the nature of lighting on the planet, the air composition, some materials present on it, etc.

# Universal consciousness
What of the claim that the whole of existence is one consciousness? By the nature of consciousness, it cannot be the whole of existence (since consciousness, being a faculty, is an aspect of an entity and not the whole of it). Now, one could claim that the universe itself is a brain that supports a consciousness. However, not only is this an arbitrary claim, but it also does not contradict any metaphysical axioms or anything derived from them. Why? Because even if there exists such a consciousness, it is by its very nature a product of existence and not existence as a whole. It would be an incredible discovery in astronomy, perhaps, but it would not shake metaphysics or even physics.
