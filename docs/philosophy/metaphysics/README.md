# Introduction
The basis of any knowledge is a set of axioms, i.e. irreducible facts underlying everything in the scope of the field of study, underlying any observation, derivation, proof, etc. The axioms of reality are facts underlying everything in the scope of reality. Metaphysics is the study of these axioms and their implications, i.e. it is the study of the nature of reality as a whole. Metaphysics is fundamental to all thought and action; its truths — grasped implicitly or explicitly — are presupposed in any conscious thought or action, because one's basic view of reality is what guides one's basic approach to dealing with it.

Since axioms are the basis of proof, axioms themselves cannot be proved. In particular, the axioms of reality are self-evident, i.e. the evidence of their existence is their very existence. This does not mean they must be accepted on faith; we can show that the axioms are indeed axiomatic by showing that they are the irreducible basis of anything we can know, discuss or act upon further. Hence, a valid metaphysical axiom, i.e. an axiom pertaining to the nature of reality as a whole cannot even be denied without first accepting it — denying it would be self-refuting.

**Short note on "proof" and "validation"**:

Validation is the process of showing that an idea or a statement is or refers to a part of reality, i.e. that it is fact. Proof is a kind of validation that uses logic (i.e. the method of applying the law of identity and its corollaries). Logic relies on axioms which cannot be themselves subjected to logic (as they are the base of logic, logic presupposes them). But we can show that these axioms correspond to reality through (1) ostensible definitions (pointing and showing, i.e. relying on self-evident facts that any consciousness can turn its focus to and grasp) and (2) the process of showing it as inescapable through "reaffirmation through denial" (i.e. show that the axiom is relied upon even when trying to deny it).

**NOTE**: _An idea being axiomatic does not mean it cannot be described in more detail. An axiomatic idea, such as existence or consciousness, is the abstraction of a vast range of particular observations in particular contexts._

# Key definitions

**NOTE**: _The definition for "existence" is ultimately ostensive, but an indication about its nature is given below._

**Existence**:

A thing, as opposed to nothing, exists. A "thing" may be anything that exists. Existence is the set of all things that exist and any "thing" is a subset of existence. Note that the term "subset of existence" may be finite or infinite (i.e. indeterminate in size). Also note that "subset" does not refer only to a subset in a perceptual sense, i.e. what can be observed sensorily, but also to a subset in a conceptual sense, wherein the subset includes all the concretes (which may be unlimited in number) subsumed under a concept (more on concepts discussed in epistemology).

**Fact**:

A fact is that which corresponds to reality; at the most basic level, facts are discovered by the act of awareness itself for self-evident, perceptual objects. In general, a fact is of anything that exists, ex. an entity, an event, a system, an attribute, an abstraction, etc. Note that things are what they are, i.e. reality is what it is; it is up to us to find the facts based on any observations and valid conceptual framework we may hold. Note that "validity" is with respect to our existing base of knowledge (i.e. facts and integrations of facts).

**Identity**:

An identity of a thing X is a set of facts that as a whole applies only to X in the given context; some or most of these facts may apply to something else, but not all. In seeking to know the nature of something, we search for the set of facts that distinguishes this thing from another; this set of facts is this thing's identity.

_An extra definition for certain discussions_...

**Conscious unit**:

Any particular part of active consciousness, such as a particular sensation, perception, concept, thought, emotion, etc.

# Axiom 1: Existence exists
Existence exists. More precisely, only existence exists, and existence only exists. (1) If not only existence exists, then something outside existence exists. But this must be a part of existence. Therefore, only existence exists. (2) If existence does not only exist, then existence can also not exist. But this would not be existence, and nothing is not something, i.e. there cannot "be" nothing. Therefore, existence only exists.

Existence is not an irreducible whole; we exist and are aware of things that exist as a part of existence. Any part of existence, which we shall call a "thing", exists due to the nature of existence itself. Since a thing is a part of existence and not the whole, it is not true that only it exists, because saying so would deny the existence of other things that exist. However, since a thing is a part of existence, it is true that it only exists, because if it does not exist, then it is not a part of existence and hence is not a thing.

# _The axiomatic fact of consciousness_

Existence exists and I am aware of it. In other words, there exists a faculty of perceiving that which exists, i.e. there exists consciousness. This is a fundamental, axiomatic (i.e. cognitively irreducible) fact; denying it is self-refuting.

---

**NOTE: Consciousness needs an object**:

Consciousness is necessarily the consciousness of something. To say that consciousness need not be conscious of anything is to say that consciousness can be aware of absolutely nothing while still being "conscious". This destroys the very meaning of consciousness, because it makes no distinction between the conscious, the unconscious, and the non-conscious. If this leads you to conclude that there is no consciousness, then you are contradicting the basic, inescapable fact of your own existence. How are you identifying "consciousness" when there is no such thing? How are you identifying "unconsciousness" without being aware of anything, i.e. without having the capacity to identify anything?

# Axiom 2: The law of identity
A thing is what it is, and this is the law of identity. If a thing is not what it is, it would both exist and not exist at the same time. But as a part of existence, it must only exist; hence, the law of identity is absolute.

---

**SIDE NOTE: One in the many, many in the one**:

One might say that a thing may be multiple things at once, or multiple things may be referred to as one. However, this is the conflation of abstractions with their concrete referents. When I say "thing", I am referring to a particular, concrete part of reality, which can be identified through a variety of abstractions that focus on some attributes and omit the rest. Note also that when multiple things are referred to as one, I am abstracting their similarities, omitting their differences and retaining this abstraction as a unified whole that can be broken down into its concrete referents when necessary. Thus, note that by "thing" here, I am referring to a particular, concrete part of reality rather than the abstractions derived from it. However, the law of identity naturally extends to abstractions too, in the sense that any abstraction in a given context refers to a particular subset of reality and no other, and thus, has only a particular meaning in the given context and no other.

## Non-contradiction
If A contradicts B, that means A exists while B does not, and B exists while A does not. If both hold true, then (1) A exists and does not exist and (2) B exists and does not exist. This violates the law of identity. Hence, if A contradicts B, then A and B cannot both exist at once, which means either A exists or B exists or both do not exist (if possible). This is the law of non-contradiction and is a corollary of the law of identity.

## Existence is identity
The previous paragraphs point to the fact that to exist is to be something, i.e. to have identity. In other words, existence is identity. To reiterate a previous point in other terms, if X does not have an identity, then X is not X, i.e. X does not exist. This is to reiterate the fact that identity is not something that just "happens to be the case in existence", but rather, identity is an integral, inseparable aspect and implication of the fact of existence 

## Note on the application of the concept of identity
To expand on the concept of identity, note that an existent X cannot have contradictory attributes, i.e. attributes that negate each other. Furthermore, any existent X can have neither more attributes than its identity allows nor less attributes than its identity demands.

For example, observing that the presence of a colour negates the presence of other colours in a given space, we can say that an object cannot be all red and all green at the same time. Similarly, observing that various attributes of a stone and a leaf contradict each other (ex. a stone is rigid and hard while a leaf is flexible and soft, a stone does not grow from plants while a leaf is a vital part of a plant, etc.), we can say that an object cannot be a stone and a leaf at the same time.

Now, consider the example of a light bulb. Saying that a light bulb is also an ornament does not contradict its identity, because its use as an ornament involves some subset of its existing attributes, such as solidity, aesthetics, etc., and no contradicting attributes.

To expand on the previous example, it would be wrong to state that a light bulb is only an ornament, because it would omit a variety of existing attributes demanded by its identity. Similarly, it would be wrong to call every ornament a light bulb, because it may not have the required attributes to be a light bulb.

## The principle of causality
_First, some definitions_...

**NOTE**: _Entities and actions must ultimately be defined through ostensive definitions since they are concepts from direct perceptions that are irreducible to other perceptions; at the basic levels, an entity is grasped as a whole, an action or a change is a single perception, etc. But I shall indicate some defining aspects that can show where to look._

**Entity**:

An entity is a subset of existence whose identity is independent of one's consciousness; it is a concrete, or a concrete referent of an abstraction (hence, everything that exists is either an entity or a metaphysically inseparable aspect of an entity). It can be composed of one or more entities — components — each with its own identity, or it can be irreducible, but it exists and is what it is independent of consciousness. Note that an entity can be a specific arrangement (i.e. interconnections) of other entities (all entities are either irreducible entities or arrangements of irreducible entities) to which different non-identifying facts may apply at different times (ex. position, movement, change in shape — given that the arrangement is not tied to the shape).

**NOTE**: _Given the above concept of entity, facts are thus facts of entities (i.e. facts are metaphysically inseparable from and derived from entities) ultimately (i.e. maybe indirectly, but certainly)._

**Action**:

An action is a change of an entity, i.e. a difference in the past and the present of an entity. More precisely, an action is a change in the facts about an entity (identifying or non-identifying; of course, change in identifying facts would lead to the entity ceasing to exist). An action, thus, is necessarily of the entity, i.e. an action cannot exist apart from the entity, and thus, an action cannot exist apart from the entity's identity; an action is hence an aspect of the entity's identity (just to clarify, an action is inseparable from the entity, the entity is inseparable from its identity, thus an action is inseparable from the entity's identity). Moreover, due to the law of non-contradiction, an entity's action cannot be in contradiction to the entity and its identity. Hence, since an action of an entity can exist neither apart from (i.e. disconnected from) nor in contradiction to the entity and its identity, an action is an expression and extension of the entity's identity.

**NOTE**: _To mention both "entity" and "entity's identity" in this context is redundant, but it is done for the sake of clarity._

---

_Back to the discussion on causality_...

Causality is the law of identity applied to actions, and by extension, events (which are the result of the actions and interactions of two or more entities). An entity's action can exist neither apart from its identity nor in contradiction to its identity, which is to say that an entity can only act according to its identity. By extension, a subset of existence can only change according to the identities of the entities acting and interacting within it.

**NOTE**: _Pointing out that actions cannot exist apart from entities and their identities is key in showing that their identities (i.e. their natures) result in certain actions in a certain context, i.e. the actions are based on the identities. This, of course, is necessary to reach the law of causality._

This is the principle of causality: actions and events have identities that are metaphysically inseparable from and derived from the identities of the entities that act. Hence, given an entity with a particular identity, its actions (in a certain relation to other entities and their actions) can have only a particular corresponding identity and nothing else (_note that an entity exists in the context of other entities and their actions, which can affect its own actions_). Thus, the law of causality means that given the same facts, nothing else can happen, i.e. the same entities in the same conditions can act only in a certain way and no other (i.e. their actions can have only a certain identity with respect to their own identities and no other). In other words, entities cause actions and all actions are caused by entities. Furthermore, the causes of any occurrence—in theory—can be identified. In practice, the identification of causes is limited by the extent of our knowledge.

The concept of causality can be applied to entities as such (rather than just actions) only when the given entities, by their nature, had to be formed through some process at some point. In such cases, the cause of an entity refers to the action or actions of some entity or entities that led to its formation. However, for existence as a whole there can be no prior cause; by the nature of existence, only it exists and it only exists. It is also invalid to say it was its own cause; saying so implies that it existed before it existed—a contradiction. There can be no cause of existence, since cause presupposes existence.

---

**NOTE 1**: Given that everything that exists is a part of reality that exists in a certain context (i.e. with respect to certain facts), a cause is not merely the actions of a set of entities, but the actions of a set of entities in a certain context (i.e. with respect to certain facts, ex. conditions, relationships, etc.).

**NOTE 2**: The law of causality is a necessary, inseparable implication of the law of identity; you cannot have identity without causality. To go even further, causality is inherent in the very fact of existence; no part of existence exists nor can exist beyond causality.

# The primacy of existence
Metaphysically, existence is not defined in terms of "physical", "mental", etc., only in terms of existence qua existence, i.e. existence as a whole. The self-evident facts validated as axioms are: (1) Existence is absolute. (2) Everything that exists must be something in particular, i.e. it must exist as what it is; the law of identity. (3) What an entity does is an extension of what the entity is; the law of causality. (4) Consciousness exists and is the faculty that perceives that which exists. Whatever one's worldview is, it is the case that consciousness is indeed the faculty that perceives that which exists, no matter what "that" is, be it the product of one's mind, the external world, etc.

Consciousness exists and is thus a part of existence. The law of identity applies to anything that exists, and thus, consciousness has a particular identity. Its identity is distinct from its contents, because one is a faculty (with a potential to take in a variety of inputs) while the other is the input provided to the faculty. Hence, consciousness cannot include the whole of existence. Therefore, existence exists independently of consciousness. Note that by this, I do not mean that each thing that exists is independent of consciousness, since there are things — such as perceptions, concepts and ideas — that are dependent on consciousness. Rather, I mean that — apart from conscious units — things have identity whether or not there is a consciousness to perceive them.

How do we grasp the external world (i.e. the world beyond our consciousness)? In other words, what inputs provided to our faculty of awareness are derived from the external world? This is a matter of epistemology not metaphysics, but I shall briefly touch upon this. Seeing how sense-perceptions are the irreducible inputs provided to our consciousness (irreducible in terms of any mental units), we can know that these are the inputs derived from the external world, i.e. some part of reality outside our consciousness, whatever that may turn out to be. In this view, we see that consciousness is not what fundamentally creates reality, but rather that reality fundamentally exists and consciousness is a part of it. In other words, existence is primary and consciousness is secondary; the reverse would contradict the nature of both existence and consciousness. What is self-evident to us is that consciousness perceives that which exists, whatever "that" is.

Let us assume the opposite, i.e. the primacy of consciousness. Then, consciousness fundamentally creates reality, i.e. it creates everything that it perceives. If this were the case, then consciousness has to exist prior to what it perceives. But if this were the case, consciousness would have to be conscious of nothing, or unconscious, i.e. it would have to not exist when it creates something it can be conscious of — a contradiction. If consciousness were conscious of something when it created something to be conscious of, then we have the same situation but with an extra step. This results in an infinite regress that (1) does not serve to identify consciousness, and (2) contradicts the fact that one's consciousness has a starting point.

# Additional points in metaphysics
## Can we know the external world?
Again, this comes under epistemology, but since it is strongly based on the nature of consciousness, we shall speak of it here. There is a claim that everything we can ever know is what is within our consciousness, and thus, we cannot know reality as it is. This view ignores the source of knowledge as we gain it. It is obvious that everything that our consciousness holds is within consciousness. However, given the fact that consciousness has to begin with an input outside of itself, we have a clear, identifiable connection to a world outside our consciousness. How do we identify it? By identifying the conscious units that are irreducible to further mental units. These units may include internal or external sensations and we can identify the source of these sensations by identifying their point of entry into our awareness. Note that here, "internal" and "external" are terms relative to the physical apparatus on which our consciousness rests (to the extent that we can be aware of it). Even if a sensation is internal, its source is still initially outside our consciousness.

Now, one may claim that since sensations can be replicated within our brain without the need for an actual object to be sensed, we cannot know whether our sensations are derived from the internal or the external world. Firstly, whatever these sensations are, they are some form of knowledge beyond our consciousness. Secondly, the claim that our brain is being misled in this manner is arbitrary; it is conceivable, but is it actual? If it were actual, how could we know it or test for it? In truth, being arbitrary, this claim is outside the realm of cognition (arbitrary claims shall be further discussed in epistemology). The truth is that whatever is the starting point of our consciousness, it is derived from some part of reality outside it. What part that is, is up to us to find out using our consciousness. The fact remains, however, that we have a clear link between consciousness and the reality outside it on some level.

## Universal consciousness
What of the claim that the whole of existence is one consciousness? By the nature of consciousness, it cannot be the whole of existence (since consciousness, being a faculty, is an aspect of an entity and not the whole of it). Now, one could claim that the universe itself is a brain that supports some consciousness. However, not only is this an arbitrary claim, but it also does not contradict any metaphysical axioms or anything derived from them. Why? Because even if there exists such a consciousness, it is by its very nature a product of existence and not existence as a whole. It would be an incredible discovery in cosmology, perhaps, but it would not shake metaphysics or even physics.

## The structure and composition of consciousness and reality
Apart from the axioms and their corollaries derived from the fact of existence, metaphysics does not make any claims about the specific structure and composition of either consciousness or reality itself; the study of these is the rightful domain of the special sciences. However, metaphysics underlies any further pursuit of knowledge and its truths are absolute within any field of study. The same level of absolute truth applies to any knowledge whose sole context (apart from other direct, self-evident observations) is metaphysics itself, which includes epistemology and extends to ethics (whose context includes epistemology as well as metaphysics).

Hence, metaphysics is not cosmology, astronomy, fundamental physics, etc., though it underlies these disciplines. Whether the universe is a simulation, part of a multiverse or anything else that you may find it out to be, the same metaphysics applies, as well as the same epistemology and ethics. Whatever specific structure or composition reality has, the basic nature of reality is what it is. Similarly, metaphysics is not biology, psychology, neuroscience, etc., though — again — it underlies these disciplines. Whatever model of consciousness we may uncover, the basic nature of consciousness and its relationship to the rest of reality is what it is.
