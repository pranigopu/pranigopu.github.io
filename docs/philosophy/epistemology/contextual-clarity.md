# What is contextual clarity and why care about it?
Contextual clarity refers to the clear grasp of the context (i.e. the sum of interrelated facts) that conditions the meaning of a given conscious unit. For example, the context of the concept of "automobile" (a bit oversimplified for the example) consists of one's concrete observations of various living and non-living moving objects, one's grasp of machinery and its distinction from living beings, one's grasp of powered mechanical motion and locomotion, one's concepts of various kinds of locomotive vehicles of which an automobile is one kind, etc. As another example, the context of the idea of "trade" (a bit oversimplified for the example) consists of one's distinction between the nature of animals and the nature of humans, one's grasp of the fact that individual capacities differ and that the time and effort is finite and cannot be spent on everything one needs or wants, one's grasp of the benefit of exchange of values between individuals, one's grasp of the distinction between an exchange done voluntarily versus involutarily, etc.

Without context, "automobile" and "trade" are floating abstractions, i.e. conscious units detached from our grasp of reality, existing as if they were percetual units rather than an integrated grasp of one's actual perception in reality. Furthermore, in the wrong context, i.e. the context apart from the one that gave rise to an abstraction, a given abstraction either takes on a meaning that may or may not be supported by reality (thereby becoming floating in essence) or merges with another abstraction that has another perhaps contradictory meaning (contradictory to the original abstraction). For example, if we omit the aspect of voluntary exchange in trade, the idea of "trade" is indistinguishable from "extortion", an equivocation that destroys the essence of "trade" and thereby destroys our ability to deal with value-exchange in a _consistently_ constructive way (since we confuse the constructive way with the destructive way).

Hence, we see the hints of the answer to the question: why preserve the meaning of abstractions, i.e. why care about contextual clarity? Moreover, what is the harm in confusing abstractions? To answer, we must understand the importance of abstractions. Metaphysically, only concretes exist. However, since reality is identifiable, non-contradictory and causal, concretes are things in particular and exist, act and react neither in isolation nor in contradiction of facts. In other words, concretes always exist in a logical relationships to other concretes, logical relationships based on identity and causality. Examples of such relationships are: their similarities and differences to each other, their effects on each other over time, their abbility or inability to coexist, etc. For example, we observe that red and green cannot exist in the same place, at the same time and when viewed from the same perspective. As another example, we observe that winds blow lighter objects more strongly than heavier ones. As another example, we observe that the heartbeat of a living being is the cause of its blood circulation.

To put it broadly, reality is a integrated sum, integrated by identity and causality. Hence, to understand the nature of any part of reality, e.g. the nature of any given concrete, we must understand its logical relationship to other concretes. In other words, we must grasp an integrated context of facts to understand the importance of any one fact. Now, note that abstractions are the selective focus of facts in reality, which helps bring to focus what is implicit in what we perceive. For example, we can selectively focus on the essential characteristics of a tree to be its structure, size and its tendency to grow and spread toward sunlight. By selectively focusing on the essentials and omitting the concrete details that may vary (e.g. the shape of the leaves, the exact arrangement of the branches, the exact environment, etc.), we can identify a new concrete as either a tree or not a tree and, if it is a tree, we can thereby know something about its nature without observing everything about it from scratch. In other words, we can identify what is implicit in our perception of a new tree by focusing on selected apsects of our observations of other trees and relating our retained selective focus to the selective focus on our new perception. Note that awareness is the only way to grasp reality, which means selective focus (i.e. directed awareness) is the only way to grasp parts or aspects of our awareness of reality (e.g. components, relationships, attributes, etc.), which means selective focus is the only way to grasp some parts of reality in relation to other parts of reality.

Hence, we see that abstraction is our fundamental means of grasping an integrated context whose scope exceeds the scope of direct awareness of reality. Since awareness is finite while the scope of reality far exceeds our direct awareness of it, abstraction is our only means to know not only what we see but also the nature of what we see, thereby giving us the means to act effectively (especially in the long-range) according to what we see. Now, given the importance of abstraction and given the fact that everything in reality exists within a specific context, i.e. in specific relationships to other things in reality, we can see that preserving the context of an abstraction is the only way to preserve its importance, i.e. it is the only way to make sure it refers to reality and thereby helps us act effectively in reality. Hence, to put it starkly, contextual clarity is at its core a matter of life and death; to deal with reality effectively, we must grasp and preserve the context of the conscious units that refer to parts or aspects of reality.
