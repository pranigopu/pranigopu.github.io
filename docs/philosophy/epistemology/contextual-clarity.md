# What is contextual clarity and why care about it?
Contextual clarity refers to the clear grasp of the context (i.e. the sum of interrelated facts) that conditions the meaning of a given conscious unit. For example, the context of the concept of "automobile" (a bit oversimplified for the example) consists of one's concrete observations of various living and non-living moving objects, one's grasp of machinery and its distinction from living beings, one's grasp of powered mechanical motion and locomotion, one's concepts of various kinds of locomotive vehicles of which an automobile is one kind, etc. As another example, the context of the idea of "trade" (a bit oversimplified for the example) consists of one's distinction between the nature of animals and the nature of humans, one's grasp of the fact that individual capacities differ and that the time and effort is finite and cannot be spent on everything one needs or wants, one's grasp of the benefit of exchange of values between individuals, one's grasp of the distinction between an exchange done voluntarily versus involutarily, etc.

Without context, "automobile" and "trade" are floating abstractions, i.e. conscious units detached from our grasp of reality, existing as if they were percetual units rather than an integrated grasp of one's actual perception of reality. Furthermore, in the wrong context, i.e. the context apart from the one that gives rise to an abstraction, the abstraction either takes on a meaning that may or may not be supported by reality (thereby becoming floating in essence) or merges with another abstraction that has another perhaps contradictory meaning (contradictory to the original abstraction). For example, if we omit the aspect of voluntary exchange in trade, the idea of "trade" becomes indistinguishable from "extortion" or, in some contexts such as the labour market,"exploitation". Such equivocation destroys the essence of "trade" and thereby destroys our ability to deal with value-exchange in a _consistently_ constructive way (since we confuse the constructive way with the destructive way).

Hence, we see the hints of the answer to the question: why preserve the meaning of abstractions, i.e. why care about contextual clarity? Moreover, what is the harm in dropping or confusing certain abstractions? To answer, we must understand the importance of abstractions. Metaphysically, only concretes exist. However, since reality is identifiable, non-contradictory and causal, concretes are things in particular and exist, act and react neither in isolation nor in contradiction of facts. In other words, concretes always exist in a logical relationships to other concretes, logical relationships based on identity and causality. Examples of such relationships between concretes are: their similarities and differences to each other, their effects on each other over time, their ability or inability to coexist, etc. For example, we observe that red and green cannot exist in the same place, at the same time and when viewed from the same perspective. As another example, we observe that winds blow lighter objects more strongly than heavier ones. As another example, we observe that the heartbeat of a living being is the cause of its blood circulation.

To put it broadly, reality is a integrated sum, integrated by identity and causality. Hence, to understand the nature of any part of reality (e.g. the nature of a given tree) we must understand its logical relationship to other parts of reality. In other words, we must grasp an integrated context of facts to understand the importance of any one fact. Now, note that abstractions are the selective focus of facts in reality, which helps bring to focus what is implicit in what we perceive. For example, we can selectively focus on the essential characteristics of a tree to be its structure, size and its tendency to grow and spread toward sunlight. By selectively focusing on the essentials and omitting the concrete details that may vary (e.g. the shape of the leaves, the exact arrangement of the branches, the exact environment, etc.), we can identify a new concrete as either a tree or not a tree and, if it is a tree, we can thereby know something about its nature without observing everything about it from scratch. In other words, we can identify what is implicit in our perception of a new tree by focusing on selected apsects of our observations of other trees and relating our retained selective focus to the selective focus on the new observation. Note that awareness is the only way to grasp reality, which means selective focus (i.e. directed awareness) is the only way to grasp parts or aspects of our awareness of reality (e.g. components, relationships, attributes, etc.), which means selective focus is the only way to grasp some parts of reality in relation to other parts of reality.

Hence, we see that abstraction is our fundamental means of grasping an integrated context whose scope exceeds the scope of our direct awareness of reality in the moment. Since awareness is finite while the scope of reality far exceeds our direct awareness of it, abstraction is our only means to know not only what we see but also the nature of what we see, thereby giving us the means to act effectively (especially in the long-range) according to what we see. Now, given the importance of abstraction and given the fact that everything in reality exists within a specific context, i.e. in specific relationships to other things in reality, we can see that preserving the context of an abstraction is the only way to preserve its importance, i.e. it is the only way to make sure it refers to reality and thereby helps us act effectively in reality. Hence, to put it starkly, contextual clarity is at its core a matter of life and death; to deal with reality effectively, we must grasp and preserve the context of the conscious units that refer to parts or aspects of reality.

_To re-emphasise the last point in another way_...

Understanding how something relates to the rest of reality (as far as it affects us) is key to understanding how it exists, acts, interacts and plays in reality (as far as it affects us). The right context is that which relates something to everything in reality that affects us and thereby our pursuit of values. Hence, we see that nothing can be understood as part of reality or a potential part of reality without understanding the context in which it exists or would exist. Reality is integrated by identity and causality, which is why to understand reality, we must also integrate our knowledge of it by identity and causality, i.e. by observing similarities and differences and discovering logical and causal relationships. Evidently, the right integration needs the right context.

# Sources of contextual unclarity
Since the basis of contextual clarity is holding the right context, all fallacies leading to contextual unclarity are types of the same one fallacy: context-dropping ("context-dropping" was first identified by Ayn Rand. See: [Context-dropping](https://courses.aynrand.org/lexicon/context-dropping/)). In essence, context-dropping is the fallacy of detaching a conscious unit from the context that validates it, i.e. disregarding the relationships to the facts that tie the idea to reality. We shall look at context-dropping from the most basic level, i.e. context-dropping in self-evidence, then work out way to context-dropping at higher levels of integration.

## Non-self-evident self-evidence fallacy
This the fallacy of regarding the truth of a conscious unit as self-evident when the referent of the conscious unit is not inherent in one's direct awareness of reality. The reason why it is a fallacy is made clear in ["Self-evidence with respect to higher knowledge" from _Knowledge and Certainty_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/knowledge-and-certainty.html#self-evidence-with-respect-to-higher-knowledge).

## Floating abstraction fallacy
This is the fallacy of retaining an end result of concept-formation without retaining its connection to concretes. The reason it is a fallacy is clear: any abstraction draws its meaning only from a particular context, ultimately tied to particular (though potentially infinite) concretes. An abstraction says nothing and has no practical applicability if not tied to the concretes it draws from, which means working with "floating abstractions" is a symbolic puzzle rather than actual cognition of the facts.

**NOTE**: _Even when the concept seems clear in definition, as long as it is not tied to and reducible (by yourself) to concretes and concrete contexts, it stays floating._

## Unpurposeful abstraction fallacy
The fallacy of forming an abstraction based on arbitrary criteria not based on any clear cognitive purpose. Why is purpose important? Purpose is essentially the orientation of an entity to acting in a way directed by a self-driven cause. If there is no self-driven cause by which an entity orients itself, the entity's interactions with reality are nothing but causes and effects without purpose. Now, note that there is no cognition without purpose; how can you act to gain any particular knowledge if you cannot orient yourself to gaining something in particular? Hence, purposeless cognition is contradiction: it is to act to gain knowledge without being able to act to gain knowledge. Even if we grant the existence of cognition without purpose, it would be identical to marking without meaning, i.e. meaningless effects of reality on your being.

Hence, to drop the purpose of an abstraction is to drop purpose in cognition. Hence, a purposeless abstraction is as good as nothing, i.e. it has no cognitive value. Since concept-formation is the basis for further abstraction, purposeless abstraction begins with taking definitions of concepts for granted without making sure they are useful within our context. For example, when arguing against free will, a person may use a supernaturalistic definition of free will that does not serve the purpose of referring to the natural process by which we direct our focus. By not seeing what purpose the concept of "free will" should serve, the person may come to accept the other side of the false dichotomy of "supernatural free will vs. natural determinism".

As another example, consider the distinction of "objectivity vs. subjectivity" being defined as "the contents in reality in and of itself, i.e. apart from consciousness vs. the contents held within consciousness". The distinction serves no purpose in understanding the right epistemological approach, since it makes no distinction between the conscious units that correspond to reality and the ones that do not. Moverover, what cognitive purpose does the concept of "the contents of reality in and itself" serve apart from the concept of "reality"? Based on our useless definitions, if we reach the view that "objectivity is impossible" and "all knowledge is subjective", we fail to distinguish between the conscious units the help us deal with reality as it is and the ones that do not, thereby paralysing our pursuit of knowledge and efficacy in dealing with reality by making us either doubtful about everything or certain about everything.

_Further note on universal doubt vs. universal certainty to show their consequences_...

What are the consequences of each of the above two positions? The consequences of the former: lack of conviction, lack of efficacy in the pursuit of knowledge, lack of motivation toward the pursuit of truth and efficacy, etc. The consequences of the latter: taking whims and emotions as knowledge, holding revelations or intuitions as truth instead of seeking evidence, etc. Now, note a key point based on [Knowledge and Certainty](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/knowledge-and-certainty.html): certainty is the basic state of human cognition and must be reached in accordance to the facts in order to deal with reality effectively. Someone who doubts "everything" cannot really doubt everything unless he forgoes his consciousness. Hence, he must hold some things as certain. But since he has no means of making the distinction between reality and fantasy, the validity of what he holds as certain is up to chance. Ultimately, both positions (universal doubt and universal certainty) lead to false or unfounded certainty. Of course, acting on false or unfounded certainty is profoundly irrational and devalues your life since you degrade or destroy your efficacy in dealing with reality.

_Hence, we can see the sheer importance in keeping clear what our cognitive purpose is._

## Inserted context fallacy
This is the fallacy of replacing elements of the context of an idea or add new elements to it that have no basis in the original context.

## Integration by non-essentials
This is the fallacy of stating that two things are similar in some respect because they are similar in other respects. By things, I mean anything: percepts, concepts, contexts, etc. Examples of this fallacy are: (1) Thinking that something is made of metal just because it shines. (2) Thinking two species have similar mating behaviour due to similar hunting behaviour. (3) Thinking of contractual labour as a form of slavery. (4) Thinking of a fetus as a rights-holding human due it having its own biologically human body. (5) Thinking of capitalism as imperialism because both promote "expansion of economic influence".(6) Thinking of outcompeting a job-seeker for a job as outmatching a nation in a war of conquest. (7) Thinking of "trust" as "faith" because both lack "direct evidence". (8) Thinking of similar outcomes of decisions as showing similar decision-making quality. (9) Thinking of a specific outcome of an action as the key factor in judging the morality of the action (e.g. morally equating cold-blooded murder with killing someone in self-defence).

Now, how can you know integration is done by non-essentials and why is doing so important? The more essential a characteristic of a thing is in a given context, the more of the thing's identity necessitates and is necessitated by in the given contexts, i.e. the more of the thing's identity is integrated by the characteristic in the given context. For example, an essential of butter in the context of food is the fact that it is a milk-based fat. This characteristic alone integrates much of the nature of butter in a day-to-day context, such as its greasiness, its use as a fatty substance, its danger for lactose intolerance, etc. Note that like cognition in general, an essential is both contextual (i.e. based on a body of interrelated facts) and purposeful (i.e. based on a goal or a hierarchy of goals). Hence, an essential is that which integrates much of the context in a way that is relevant to our purpose. Why does integrating the context give it such relevance? Because by causality, a thing acts as a thing is, which means that since an essential characteristic is key to understanding the nature of a thing or an idea, especially long-range or in a broader context, it also key to understanding how the thing or the idea relates to the rest of reality, i.e. how it would act, react or play out in reality.

Hence, by integrating by non-essentials, you are no longer dealing with reality since you are in fact making two errors: you are both dropping the context with respect to essential differences and inserting an imagined context with respect to imagined essential similarities. in other words, by integrating by non-essentials, you drop the context and separate your cognition from reality. Hence, to deal with reality effectively needs the right integration within the right context, which is only achieved through integration by _essentials_.

_How to integrate by essentials?_

The model to follow when integrating with essentials is an extension of the method used in concept-formation, which is one of the basic kinds of integration. In concept-formation, you identify the broader context in which two kinds of units

To clarify, consider some examples.

1.

What is wrong with equating economic "conquest", e.g. outcompeting your competition in business for the sake of economic power, with imperial conquest, e.g. conquering another nation for the sake of political power. First, we must identify the broader context that integrates both cases, namely the context of human interaction. What is essential to deciding the effectiveness of human interaction on the broadest of terms? The answer: rational freedom, i.e. the freedom to act according to one's own judgement in the absence of physical coercion in any direction (for the proof of it, see: [_Morality in a Social Context_](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/morality-in-social-context.html)). Here, we see that on the two kinds of conquests are distinguished in the broader context by an essential characteristic of the broader context, namely the use of physical coercion or lack thereof. Economic conquest leaves people unviolated physically, i.e. with respect to their bodies and their property, while political conquest does in fact violate every human right.

To show how essentials are key to understanding reality, consider what kinds of other characteristics are integrated by the essential characteristics of each kind of conquest. In the first case, the rights of people are protected, economic freedom is present (which tends toward overall prosperity, all else equal), individual agency is respected both by the state and by other people, leaving people free to pursue their own happiness in the long run. In the second case, the principle of individual rights is thrown out in essence, which means economic freedom is not protected and is always under the threat of arbitrary decree, individual agency is not respected in principle by the state, opening the doors to accepting all kinds of evils, such as expropriation of wealth, forced conformity (intellectually and practically) and physical exploitation of those with less political power or favour. Also, consider what incentives does each kind of conquest present and what kinds of people does each kind of system draw? In the first kind, individual agency and responsibility is emphasised, incentivising the more conscientious, productive and entreprising. The the second kind, physical and political might is emphasised, incentivising a system based not on merit but pull, drawing the unscrupulous and the power-hungry, both as conformists or as perpetrators of physical and economic coercion.

 (E.g. considering equal outcomes in a specific context as essential to moral judgement, job market competition vs. conquest by war, murder vs. accidental manslaughter, killing one healthy man to harvest his organs to save many others vs. diverting a train toward less people tied to the tracks than more people tied to a track, etc.).
