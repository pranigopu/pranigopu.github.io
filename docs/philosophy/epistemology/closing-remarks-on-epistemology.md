# LINK TO HUMAN NATURE: Rationality as the full realisation of volition
To be a volitional being to the fullest is equivalent to being rational to the fullest. Why? Reason is the use of volition from the perceptual level (the last inexorably non-volitional stage of cognition) to focus based on (1) awareness of motives and (2) awareness of facts. It is the faculty that is based on, relies on and most uses the faculty of volition. To have as a fundamental approach either impulsivity or instinctiveness is to not exercise your volition in favour of automatic, subconscious or unconscious drives.

_Thus, to be volitional to the full is to be rational to the full and vice versa._

**NOTE**: _Needless to say, not all volitional acts are rational, but I posit that they are not rational when they are evasive on a deeper level, i.e. when they involve the unfocusing of the mind from reality and rely at their core on automatic non-perceptual responses. Hence, being a volitional being is equivalent to being rational if and only if one exercises one's volition to one's fullest capacity for every level of cognition beyond the perceptual level._

# LINK TO ETHICS: Staying in existence as the basic purpose
_In ethics, I show that one's own life is the standard of value, i.e. the highest value and the source of all values. Here, I shall show the same idea from an epistemological perspective. I shall show that the only purpose fundamentally is the purpose of staying in existence as what you are, and since that any form of cognition needs purpose, I shall show that knowledge implies and is implied by the idea of one's own life as the standard of value._

How do you grasp the self-evident? By staying in awareness. Why to grasp the self-evident? To stay in existence as a conscious being, i.e. to preserve your faculty of awareness, because to be aware is to be aware of something that is what it is. Why to grasp anything beyond the self-evident? To stay in existence as a volitional being, i.e. to preserve your faculty of self-driven awareness. If you do not care to do so, why think? For no purpose? But thinking is impossible without purpose. So, for a purpose of something or someone beyond you? But if the purpose is beyond you, your awareness cannot be self-driven because what drives you is something beyond you.

But you are what you are and cannot be what you are not. Thus, the moment you lose the capacity to be self-driven, you no longer exist. But can you or what remains of you at least be aware? Do you act to stay in awareness as long as you are awake? If so, that is your purpose. But if the purpose is still beyond you, you can have no purpose since no purpose you act upon arises from you. You no longer exist. Thus, the only purpose is to preserve yourself as you are, i.e. as a being of self-driven awareness, i.e. as a being alive, aware and desirous of being both. If such is not your purpose, you cannot think, you cannot be aware and ultimately, you cannot exist. To the extent that you have such purpose, to that extent you are aware and care to exist, and to the extent that you do not, to that extent you give up your awareness and let yourself fade away.

Rationality is the self-driven effort to grasp reality and act accordingly, i.e. it is the self-driven effort to know and to act on one's own knowledge. Hence, rationality is the virtue of choosing to stay in existence as what you are, i.e. as a volitional being. Hence, it is the virtue that is the source of every other virtue, since it strives toward the purpose that is the source of every other purpose. Hence, every virtue is a form of rationality, since every purpose is a form of staying in existence as what you are.
