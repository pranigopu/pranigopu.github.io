# Self-evidence
_This section is lifted directly from_ [Metaphysics](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/metaphysics).

**LEXICAL NOTE**:

To affirm something is to grasp (either explicitly or implicitly) that it exists, i.e. that it is real. To accept something is to hold that it exists; acceptance can also exist when what is being accepted does not exist. Hence, affirmation is affirmation of what is, whereas acceptance is acceptance of a proposition about either something that is or something that is not. Note also that to deny something is to hold that it does not exist (it is the inverse of acceptance); denial can also exist when what is being denied does exist. Hence, note a key point: accepting or denying something is independent of affirming it, since you affirm it as long as you grasp and rely on its existence.

_Back to the main topic_...

The self-evident is the direct awareness of reality. It is the opposite of the arbitrary; the self-evident is inherent in existence as such and is that which is given to us by reality directly. Hence, the self-evident is also the opposite of faith, which is why it is important to see how we reach the fact that something is self-evident. I shall show that the self-evident is at the core of all awareness and all knowledge. Hence, by its nature, the self-evident is that which one affirms even in trying to deny it, since no act of awareness can deny that which awareness presupposes by its very existence (needless to say, the unaware cannot affirm or deny anything).

## Awareness is and knowledge is
To be aware of something is to perceive and thereby affirm that it is, i.e. that it exists. Note that awareness is always awareness of something; awareness of nothing is unawareness. Now, note that _knowledge is the retained awareness of something_. Hence, to know something is to affirm that it is and retain the affirmation. Now, my awareness is, i.e. it exists; if it does not, I can affirm or deny nothing, i.e. I can say nothing. To the extent that I say something, to that extent I affirm that my awareness is, i.e. that I am aware. Hence, since knowledge is the retained awareness of something, and since I am aware and capable of retaining my awareness of things, knowledge is, i.e. knowledge exists. In other words, since I am aware and capable of retaining my awareness of things, I know something and never nothing.

# Knowledge
## Self-evidence is the basis of knowledge
_Here, we only reaffirm what was said in the above discussion on self-evidence_.

From the above discussion on self-evidence, we see that to know something is to be aware of something that exists, i.e. something that is a part of reality. In other words, a piece of knowledge is a fact grasped by consciousness, i.e. it is a conscious unit that corresponds to reality based on self-evident truths such denying it would _ultimately_ lead you to affirm it ("ultimately" is used because more than one self-evident truth may be needed to reach the affirmation; we shall soon see why). Hence, self-evidence, i.e. the direct awareness of something that exists, is the basis of knowledge.

## Selective focus is the means to expand knowledge
Awareness begins at perception, but we also grasp that we can selectively focus on some parts of our perception isolated from the other parts. Note that we do have the capacity for selective focus. How do we know that we do? By the self-evident fact that we are aware of our retained awareness and thus can focus on parts of our retained awareness, which means we can focus on parts of perception just as we focus on parts of the world outside our consciousness. Note that selective focus naturally extends to all conscious units, not just percepts but also units, concepts, generalisations, etc.

_Importance and use of selective focus_...

In [Integration of Perception](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/4-integration-of-perception.html), we see how selective focus leads to the capacity for abstraction, which is necessary to know reality beyond direct perception by relating facts to a broader context of facts. For example, we can relate our interactions with various metal items to each other to observe similarities that also distinguish them from items made of other materials (e.g. we can polish them to make them shine, we can hit it against hard surfaces to make bright sounds, we can bend a sufficiently thin metal item and it keeps its bent shape, etc.). Then, when we observe a new item with similar characteristics, we can explore it with the knowledge that it may be a metal item and may have the other characteristics observed in the metal items we know.

As another example, we can relate our interactions with solid objects to each other and to our interactions with semi-solids and liquids to observe the similarities that also distinguish them from the others (e.g. fixed shape when pressed, moved and struck against other objects). We can hence observe that some characteristics that distinguish solids are also necessary to, say, stack objects in a stable heap. Hence, we can relate our knowledge of solid objects to any new solid object we observe to know (without any further observations) whether it can be made a part of a stable heap. Expanding on the example, we can relate our knowledge of how shape, weight and support affects a solid object's stability to know (without any further observations) which new solid objects to put at the bottom of the heap and which to put at the top.

As a more complex example, consider Newton's first law of motion ("every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force"), where Newton related observations of the horizontal movement of different objects in different surfaces, selectively focusing on the difference that made the difference, namely, the amount of friction of the surface. Hence, he could identify that the friction of a surface was the causal factor in slowing down a body moving on the surface, he grasped that in the absence of friction, the object would not slow down. He also related observations of the motion of objects to selectively focus on the fact that an increase in an object's speed was caused by an external force, in the absence of which it would not speed up. Similarly, he grasped that nothing except an external force caused the change in the direction of an object's motion. Without selective focus, every observation would be a whole new phenomenon with no relationship (beyond perceptual similarities and differences) to other observations.

_The importance and use of selective focus in expanding knowledge leads us to the next point_...

## The basic means of knowledge
Knowledge can only be knowledge of the self evident, because only the self-evident is given by reality. To re-emphasise, only something given by reality to the consciousness is knowledge of reality, but something given by reality is self-evident, i.e. even to deny its existence is to affirm it, since it just is. Now, if knowledge is only of the self-evident, then expanding our knowledge beyond perception can only be awareness of what is self-evidently implicit in our perception. As we have seen, such awareness is only reached by selective focus. Hence, we see that knowledge has only two basic means: grasping the self-evident and selectively focusing on the self-evident. Of course, selective focus can only lead to knowledge if used to grasp what is self-evidently implicit in the self-evident.

_Grasping the means of knowledge leads us to a key fact about knowledge_...

## All knowledge is relational
All knowledge is either directly self-evident or selective focus of the self-evident. Now, as we have seen, selective focus can be either selective focus of some parts of a conscious unit or selective focus of parts relating two or more conscious units. Hence, selective focus differentiates (i.e. differentiating parts of a unit from the whole or differentiating two or more units by their differences) and integrates (i.e. integrating parts of a unit into the whole or integrating two or more units by their similarities). In both cases, new knowledge is gained only by relating something to something else, e.g. identifying a part of a unit in relation to the whole or identifying a relationship between two or more units. The fact that knowledge is relational is made apparent in the way we gain knowledge beyond perception, namely [unit-perception](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/5-unit-perception.html), concept-formation and generalisation.

**NOTE**: _When gaining knowledge of the parts of a unit, you necessarily identify them in relation to the whole. Why? Consider: what if you regard each part as separate from the whole? Then, your grasp of each part as well as your grasp of the parts together do not correspond to reality, since you regard them as separate from the whole when they are not. In other words, such a disintegrated grasp of reality does not lead to knowledge._
