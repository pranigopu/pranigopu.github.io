# Self-evidence
_This section is lifted directly from_ [Metaphysics](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/metaphysics).

**LEXICAL NOTE**:

_To affirm something is to grasp (either explicitly or implicitly) that it exists, i.e. that it is real. To accept something is to hold that it exists; acceptance can also exist when what is being accepted does not exist. Hence, affirmation is affirmation of what is, whereas acceptance is acceptance of a proposition about either something that is or something that is not. Note also that to deny something is to hold that it does not exist (it is the inverse of acceptance); denial can also exist when what is being denied does exist. Hence, note a key point: accepting or denying something is independent of affirming it, since you affirm it as long as you grasp and rely on its existence._

The self-evident is the direct experience of reality. It is the opposite of the arbitrary; the self-evident is inherent in existence as such and is that which is given to us by reality directly. Hence, the self-evident is also the opposite of faith, which is why it is important to see how we reach the fact that something is self-evident. I shall show that the self-evident is at the core of all awareness and all knowledge. Hence, by its nature, the self-evident is that which one affirms even in trying to deny it, since no act of awareness can deny that which awareness presupposes by its very existence (needless to say, the unaware cannot affirm or deny anything).

## Awareness is and knowledge is
To be aware of something is to perceive and thereby affirm that it is, i.e. that it exists. Note that awareness is always awareness of something; awareness of nothing is unawareness. Now, note that _knowledge is the retained awareness of something_. Hence, to know something is to affirm that it is and retain the affirmation. Now, my awareness is, i.e. it exists; if it does not, I can affirm or deny nothing, i.e. I can say nothing. To the extent that I say something, to that extent I affirm that my awareness is, i.e. that I am aware. Hence, since knowledge is the retained awareness of something, and since I am aware and capable of retaining my awareness of things, knowledge is. In other words, since I am aware and capable of retaining my awareness of things, I know something and never nothing.

Hence, we see that to know something is to be aware of something that exists, i.e. something that is a part of reality. In other words, a piece of knowledge is a fact grasped by consciousness, i.e. it is a conscious unit that corresponds to reality based on self-evident truths such that its denial would _ultimately_ result in its affirmation, i.e. denying it would _ultimately_ lead you to affirm it ("ultimately" is used because more than one self-evident truth may be needed to reach the affirmation; we shall soon see why). Hence, self-evidence, i.e. the direct awareness of something that exists, is the basis of knowledge.
