# Why read further?
By the nature of cognition beyond the perceptual level, the exercise of reason is non-automatic, thus involving self-driven effort. A context in which facts are to be studied is often complex, i.e. it involves many parts of reality which must be dealt with selective focus and rigorous integration by a finite consciousness; the integration here is both hierarchical (i.e. relationships between the concrete and the abstract) and contextual (i.e. relationships between different facts drawn from different parts of reality). Hence, we see that the exercise of reason, i.e. rationality is not necessarily easy; indeed, it is often complex and always needs rigour, i.e. focus and logic. Hence, we must ask: why bother with rationality in every waking moment? Why not be irrational once in a while, just to "relax and enjoy life"?

Here, we see a false and — in my view — dangerous dichotomy: consistent rationality that is a constant struggle vs. inconsistent rationality that leaves room for relaxation and the enjoyment of life. In the next section, I shall show that: (1) Consistent rationality is essentially a consistent value for one's own life in every sense, from the enjoyment of the moment to long-range success. (2) Consistent rationality is not and should not be a constant struggle; indeed, I want to show that a constant struggle in the pursuit of reason is precisely what is irrational. (3) The aforementioned dichotomy is harmful to one's life and one's pursuit of happiness. In the sections after the next, I shall present my understanding of how to practice rationality in various contexts, from the everyday to the long-range.

# The nature and importance of consistent rationality
The importance of consistent rationality is almost self-evident if you consider what rationality means. Rationality is, in essence, the act of staying in focus of reality as per your capacity and acting only on your grasp of reality. Note that every concept exists in a context; I shall make the context of the concept "rationality" clearer later. I say "later" because while theory is essential as it integrates concretes and helps us grasp their nature in a broader context, it would help us to grasp the context with some concretes first since concretes are the basis of any theory. Hence, consider: is it possible to rationally take your focus away from something? If you do so rationally, it means you act on your grasp of its unimportance or at least its _relative_ unimportance in your context. Also, consider: is it possible rationally rest your mind, i.e. unfocus from reality for a while? It you do so rational, it means you act on your grasp of the value or even (if such is the case) the sheer importance of rest, and further, you act on your grasp of the fact that, in your knowledge, nothing more important needs your focus for a while.

To make my point clearer, consider: what is rationality apart from one's grasp of the facts? Nothing, as it is self-contradiction. Hence, in both cases, we see that it would evidently be irrational not to take your focus away from something or not to rest your mind if the facts you grasp are in favour of such action. Consider what would be the result of refusing to do so. Here are some stark examples: obsession over contamination (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, i.e. OCD), fixation on arbitrary threats (e.g. paranoia, phobias, etc.), disproportionate concern for social approval or the avoidance of social disapproval (disproportionate with respect to one's hierarchy of values), disregard for physical health and well-being (e.g. sleep deprivation, which degrades the ability to focus, to regulate mood and, in general, to be rational), etc.

Taking support from the above discussion, I shall now expand more theoretically on the context of the concept "rationality". Note that since rationality is based on one's conscious grasp of the facts, and since an essential fact of consciousness is its finite capacity, relevance is integral to rationality. To disregard relevance while focusing on the facts is to disregard your grasp of what is or is not important within your context. In other words, to disregard relevance is irrational. The demand to "focus on the facts" cannot by itself be rational if it is out-of-context, i.e. isolated from the facts that give it meaning. The demand to "focus on the facts" exists and can exist only in the context of a variety of facts (especially facts related to consciousness), such as: (1) consciousness has a finite capacity, (2) consciousness exists integrated with the mind and the body as a part of an inseparable whole. (3) consciousness has needs in both the short-range and the long-range, (4) a conscious being can only act effectively within a hierarchy of values, etc. In short, rationality demands relevance, which means it demands selectivity in focus and effort.

Now, consider: what if you unfocus from reality without seeing if the facts that you grasp are in line with such action? Evidently, then, you have no grasp of the importance of what you are unfocusing from since you disregard it to begin with. Is such a policy in favour of your life? Can any person who wishes to stay in existence truly rest knowing he is evading the reality in front of him? Can he truly rest assured by essentially burying his head in the sand while it is self-evident to his mind that doing so would not make what is real in front of him unreal? Moreover, can any person who wishes to stay in existence truly find enjoyment in the moment if he — as a policy — refuses to see what is important to his life as well as his enjoyment of it? Even if a person focuses on and acts according to reality but only time-to-time, he cannot but internalise a disregard for reality as such by the nature of his policy. In essence, it is like driving drunk or walking unarmed into a jungle: you might be alright in the end, but you have devalued your life and its potential and would likely degrade or destroy it by your own choices.

Consistently being rational is, in essence, consistently valuing your own life. Now, note that to value your life inconsistently as a policy is a self-contradiction: life is an integrated whole and no part of it exists in isolation, which means to actively devalue parts of it would be to actively devalue the whole of it. In other words, you cannot value your life if you devalue it as a policy. Hence, either you are consistently rational and thereby value your life, or you are inconsistently rational and thereby devalue your life, be it actively or passively. In the second case, there are two options: (1) You are inconsistently rational as a fault rather than a policy, in which case such inconsistency is necessarily a transition either from fault to virtue or from fault to vice. (2) You are inconsistently rational as a policy, in which case you do not and cannot value your life as such. Of course, man has free will, which means neither virtue nor vice are fixed states of existence, but as long as he chooses to stay in vice, he cannot value his life as such.

As a cap on the discussion so far, consider the sheer contradiction in the idea that "some irrationality" is "acceptable" or "necessary". If "acceptability" or "necessity" is based on the facts of reality, then the idea amounts to the contradictory statement: "some irrationality is rational". To make the contradiction clearer, consider what it means: "to think and act with disregard for some relevant facts is to think and act with regard for all relevant facts." Needless to say, to the extent you disregard the relevant facts, to that extent you are irrational and certainly not rational at the same time. Moreover, to the extent that you are irrational, to that extent you disregard your life and its potential; even doing so only time-to-time but as a policy is sheer irrationality. To put it briefly, rationality permits no compromise with irrationality.

**NOTE 1**: To say "relevant facts" in the above paragraph is redundant, because as we have seen, to regard facts as a whole is to regard them in the context of the nature and finite capacity of consciousness, which necessarily implies the regard of facts by relevance, since to disregard relevance is to disregard the facts that give rise to cognition in the first place. Nonetheless, I have said "relevant facts" for clarity's sake.

**NOTE 2**: To re-emphasise the key point, rationality is indispensable to one's efficacy in life: rationality as a consistent practice is the most effective way to deal with reality as a whole since rationality is the fundamental basis of efficacy in life. In essence, being rational is the only effective way to deal with reality.

# Efficiency in effort is integral to rationality
We have seen above that rationality demands relevance, which means it demands selectivity in focus and effort. Now, I shall look at a related aspect of rationality in practice, namely the need for efficiency, whose basis is the same as the basis of the need for relevance: the fact that consciousness is finite. We start by grasping where the use of reason must begin. The use of reason is the use of one's faculty of identifying and integrating the material provided by one's direct awareness of reality. Since reality is integrated by identity and causality, the use of reason must ultimately be based on the broadest context we can grasp, i.e. the context of our life as a whole, i.e. life lived long-range.

Hence, rationality does not demand that we subject ourselves to a constant, excruciating effort in every moment of our lives to perceive every detail we can so as to work our minds to analyse as many integrations as possible of what we perceive; such would be an irrational use of one's mind since it would degrade and ultimately destroy our ability to deal with life in a broader context, because consciousness is finite, values are time-bound and their achievement is conditional. Moreover, since contexts are integrated in a non-contradictory whole, such an irrational use of one's mind would also degrade and ultimately destroy our ability to deal with particulars beyond short-range reactions.

Hence, the most scrupulous use of one's reason demands not a constant, excruciating effort to focus on every detail but the _sustainable_, i.e. _efficient_ and _long-range_ application of our volition, which can painstaking or even excruciating but only when needed, which would not and should not be in one's every waking moment. Integrating our knowledge of reality does not involve agonising over every particular but recognising the _essential_ truths that form the basis of the context and the _relevant_ possible paths we may take. The scrupulous use of one's reason consists not of adding burdens to one's mind but of enabling and advancing the pursuit of one's own life and happiness; such a pursuit, of course, is profoundly rational.

Volition — and by extension reason — has to be selective, since the mind's capacity is finite while the needs of one's life are time-bound and conditional. Hence, rationality demands that we understand that which is most _relevant_, i.e. significant within our knowledge in the pursuit of our life and happiness. We cannot and should not try to know or do everything, not because of passivity but necessity; we must not disregard what is most important in our context, which means that given the finite capacity of the mind, we must disregard much of what is less important. However, note that the use of reason is always absolute; we can and must use reason even to understand why and in what way to trust others or to leave concerns unattended.

_To place the arbitrary or the unimportant (at least relatively) over what you know to be relevant and important (at least relatively) is profoundly irrational._
