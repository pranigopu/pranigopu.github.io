**SIDE NOTE**: As examples of the use of other faculties as an application of reason, consider: (1) In an emergency, it is rational to use instincts to act if it is clear that any deliberation is practically impossible or potentially detrimental to your ability to deal with the emergency. (2) In the pursuit of pleasure in the moment, it is rational to act on emotion within the context if doing otherwise would take away from the pleasure you rationally decided to seek.
