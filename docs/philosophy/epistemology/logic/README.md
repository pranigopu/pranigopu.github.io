# Logic
## Introduction
Logic is the method of non-contradictory identification; in other words, it is the method of using the faculty of reason. Hence, since rationality is the fundamental virtue of a volitional life, it is essential to gain clarity and confidence in the methods by which one can and must use one's reason effectively. The following writings are a result of notes taken and expanded from the following lecture series (on YouTube) by Dr. Leonard Peikoff:
