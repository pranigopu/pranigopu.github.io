# Need for cognitive validating standard
## Metaphysical validation
_The primacy of existence_...

Existence exists and that which exists is what it is, independent of consciousness. In other terms, facts have primacy and are independent of consciousness.

## Epistemological validation
Human consciousness is volitional, i.e. capable of selective focus of awareness of its contents. Beyond the basic sensations and perceptions, the contents–the conceptual contents–of such a consciousness do not automatically conform to reality. Therefore, human cognition needs a valid method of cognition to ensure that its contents correspond to reality.

Logic is the validating standard of cognition, i.e. the method by which a volitional, non-automatic consciousness can ensure that its contents correspond to reality.

# Forming cognitive validating standard
## Introduction
The purpose of a validating standard–logic–is to enable us to determine when our conclusions do or do not represent facts. Only a standard derived from facts, i.e. from reality can enable us to perform this function; an arbitrary standard detached from facts is detached from reality, and thus, deals with the non-existent.

In particular, since we need a standard that is applicable to any and every fact, i.e. a standard that is universally applicable to facts, we need principles inherent in the nature of facts, i.e. inherent in the nature of existence as such. In other terms, we need principles that are true of being qua being.

## The laws of logic
(Credits to: Aristotle)

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| A, B, C... | any part of reality |
| ¬   | "not" |

### The law of identity
Logic has but one law, which is the basic metaphysical axiom inherent in being qua being, namely the law of identity:

**A is A**

The subsequent laws of logic are, in essence, restatements of the law of identity. However, they are restatements for epistemological use, i.e. for the purpose of finding out whether the law of identity has been violated or not.

### The law of noncontradiction
A cannot be ¬A in the same respect.

The term "respect" means, "in relation to certain facts," i.e. "in a certain context." Note that with time, A can become ¬A in the same respect– but at that point, it is A anymore. Hence, to specify "at the same time" is redundant here.

Note that A and ¬A here can be anything; an entity, an attribute, an action, a unit, a concept, etc. Also, A and ¬A need not be the same kind of existent. With this in mind, we can apply the law of noncontradiction to the attribution of information.

---

if

A is B at a given time and in a given respect,

then

A cannot be ¬B at the same time & in the same respect.

---

To combine the above into one statement:

**A cannot be B and ¬B at the same time & in the same respect**

Note that time is emphasised because though it is implied in the term "respect", it is the most important factor to consider.

### The law of excluded middle
**Anything that exists is either A or ¬A at a given time & in a given respect**

This is validated by the law of noncontradiction. Note that the law of excluded middle does not state that A is either B or ¬B, where B is some particular. Assuming A and B are not identical, ¬A includes B but extends beyond it to include everything except A.

## Validation by reaffirmation through denial
The laws of logic, i.e. the law of identity and its corollaries, are presupposed by any and every thought and action. To deny these laws presupposes their validity, i.e. any supposed refutation of these laws is forced to count on their validity, thereby becoming self-refuting. For example, the concept of "proof" rests on the validity of logic; you cannot "prove" the validity of logic, as logic is what makes proof possible. However, this very fact validates logic, i.e. shows that logic corresponds to reality.

Validation is the process of showing that an idea corresponds to reality. Proof is a kind of validation that uses logic.

## Aspects of logical proof

A logical argument is composed of 3 broad parts:

1.  Premise–known facts or assertions
2.  Inference–application of the laws of logic
3.  Conclusion–fact necessitated by the premise and inference

For a conclusion to be true, (1) the premises must be true, and (2) the inference must be valid, i.e. must be based only on the laws of logic. Premises are validated by valid concept-formation, which in turn is validated by a hierarchy of valid abstractions based on the material provided by sense-perception. Showing that a conclusion follows logically from true premises is proof. Note that the opposite of proof is arbitrary, which is baseless and disintegrated from knowledge.

Hence, the application of logic presupposes a valid method of concept-formation. The elaboration of such a method belongs to the broader domain of epistemology, and shall not be discussed in-depth here (it is discussed to some extent in the chapter "Definitions").

# Informal fallacies

A fallacy is an invalid form of reasoning, i.e. a form of reasoning that does not in fact prove the conclusion it claims to be proving. Common or informal fallacies are fallacies that apply to any form of reasoning, be it deductive or inductive. Being aware of key fallacies enables you to

- Spot invalid arguments–plausible or not–with more ease.
- Identify the nature of the flaw in the invalid argument.

In other words, being aware of fallacies is a means of intellectual self-defence.

## Classification by nature of distortion
1. Distorting the nature of truth
    1. Truth as second-handed
        1. Argumentum ad verecundiam, i.e. Appeal to reverence
        2. Argumentum ad hominem, i.e. Appeal to the man
            1. Abusive
            2. Circumstantial
        3. Cliche thinking
    2. Truth as irrelevant
        1. Argumentum ad baculum, i.e. Appeal to the stick
        2. Appeal to laughter
    3. Truth as subjective
        1. Appeal to personal emotion
        2. Argumentum ad populum, i.e. Appeal to others’ emotion
        3. Argumentum ad misericordiam, i.e. Appeal to pity
    4. Truth as arbitrary
        1. Argumentum ad ignorantiam, i.e. Appeal to ignorance
            1. Agnostic fallacy
2. Distorting the context
    1. Unresolved ambiguity
        1. Equivocation
        2. Amphiboly
        3. Accent
            1. Excerpt-lifting
    2. Neglecting necessary context
        1. Presupposing the conclusion, i.e. Petitio principii, i.e. Begging the question
            1. Restatement
            2. Arbitrary definition
            3. Circular reasoning
            4. Question begging epithet
        2. Denying the presuppositions, i.e. Stolen concept fallacy
        3. Ignoring aspects of composition
            1. Composition fallacy
            2. Division fallacy
        4. False alternative fallacy
    3. Taking invalid presuppositions for granted
        1. Loaded/complex/leading question
        2. Misuse of the mean
        3. Double standard
            1. Special pleading

_Now for some definitions_...

**Truth**:

A cognitive element that identifies a part of reality.

**Context**:

The sum of cognitive elements in relation to which any item of human knowledge is acquired, validated or applied.

---

Note, hence, that distorting the truth involves distorting the context, and vice versa. The classification, however, is based on what distortion was primary: the explicit elements of the argument or the implicit elements not stated yet underlying the argument.

## Classification by essential error
A logical argument falls short either due to the inclusion of irrelevant elements or due to the exclusion of relevant ones. Hence, in essence, any fallacy is a combination of one or both of the following fallacies:

1.  Irrelevant conclusion (ignoratio elenchi, i.e. ignoring refutation)
    1.  Straw man fallacy
    2.  Extension
2.  Neglected aspect

In practice, due to the overarching nature of these fallacies, apply them only when none of the other more specific kinds apply.
