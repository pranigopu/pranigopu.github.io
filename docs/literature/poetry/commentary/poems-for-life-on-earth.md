"No phantoms in my veins"

In actual, concrete fact, that which is not, is not; wishful notions that have nothing to do with reality or at least your grasp of reality are not effective in orienting your mind to dealing with reality as it is.

"But if I let them in my skull, my heart would beat for null"

But we can imagine, abstract from reality. Abstractions are not invalid per se, but if we omit the context they come from and apply for, they become "phantoms". If, by letting them into my "skull" a.k.a. into my mind, I entertain such "phantoms" (e.g. wishful thinking detached from reality), my life-force (i.e. my heartbeat) would be directed toward practically nothing; I gain nothing and lose my time, energy, focus and life toward the unreal and/or arbitrary, i.e. the "null". In other words, by entertaining such "phantoms", I drain my life and consequently my serenity, happiness and values away.
