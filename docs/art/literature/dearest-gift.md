**THE DEAREST GIFT**

“Is that me, Kaspar?” Savitri asked, her eyes open wide at the sharp, stark form realised with sure and steady strokes. He nodded, not lifting his eyes off the paper and not ceasing the work of his pen. “I’m not that beautiful, you dreamer,” she said smiling, almost breaking into a laugh. As he went on drawing, he replied, “That’s only because I’ve swept away everything but the essence, your essence.” <br>
“Why? Is there so much of me you’d rather not have?” <br>
He put his pen down and looked up to her, into her eyes, eyes dark as the deepest of chasms yet radiant as the naked summer sun. He lifted his hand to touch her face, the face of the serene dusk and the hopeful dawn, decorated with the pearls he had given her, pearls that were as good as dust if not worn by her. <br>
“I want all that you are and all that you could be,” he replied, “But, you see, all that is tied together — made true — by this,” he said.

She sat beside him, looking into his eyes as deeply as he looked into hers. She drew in a breath of desire at those browns of the rich earth after rain. She gazed at the face sculpted by a thousand conquests and by a hunger for a thousand more, conquests not of men but of nature, his own and that of the world around him. A hint of a smile played on her lips, like a flower in the wind. As if to catch it, he took her in his arms and held his face over hers; their lips yearned for each other until they yearned no more.

The only way to bring new life was to make the act life-affirming, nature must have rightly thought — if nature could think. But soon, in the hands of beings alive, aware and in love with the fact that they were, the act became something purer, more selfishly grand, a grandeur that was at once never meant to be and always meant to be; never meant to be for those who played in the lap of fate, yet always meant to be for those who saw fate in the eye as they held it in their hands, not as gods but as mortals, mortals whom fate could destroy but never defeat.

Each one decided to give the other what — by the nature of life — only they could give, each for their own sake and nothing else. He held her ever closer as she cried out, crying for release yet trying, trying with all that she had to hold on to the moment, a moment stretched into a sharp, stark form realised with sure and steady strokes. He held her face as she held his, so hungry yet so replete, a fire in their eyes at the core of which was a serenity that nothing could touch, the serenity of knowing that the world was theirs to have.

# Commentary
**DISCLAIMER**: _I used ChatGPT only to interpret and analyse the above text to help judge its clarity from a third-person perspective. I did not use ChatGPT to generate or even suggest any content except for editing the word “grandness” to “grandeur” based directly on ChatGPT’s response. I also edited the word “life-giving” to “life-affirming” and added two words (“something purer”) to account for what I saw as deficiencies in clarity based on ChatGPT’s interpretations._

The description “browns of the rich earth after rain” was meant mainly as a visual description with an undertone of a lively or life-giving aspect. The use of the word “sculpted” to describe Kaspar’s face is to evoke a sense of both strength and fineness. The phrase “the face of the serene dusk and the hopeful dawn” was meant as a way to associate the best emotional aspects (in my opinion) of dusk and dawn with Savitri. Why dusk and dawn? Because it is easier to use them poetically and because they are often the most striking times of the day. In retrospect, after writing the whole text, I see that “serenity” and “hope” put together are a fitting characterisation for Savitri, which gives me all the more reason to keep the phrase.

_ChatGPT’s analysis of a line_...

**Prompt**: Comment on: pearls that were as good as dust if not worn by her

**NOTE**: _I have only included the part of the response I agree with._

**Response**:

In this case, the pearls symbolise Kaspar’s love and admiration for Savitri. They are not just adornments; they are tokens of his affection, made meaningful by their connection to her.

Furthermore, this phrase reflects the depth of Kaspar’s feelings for Savitri. It suggests that her presence enhances and elevates everything around her, transforming even the most mundane objects into something extraordinary. By emphasising the importance of Savitri’s influence, the phrase highlights the profound impact she has on Kaspar’s life and underscores the depth of their relationship.

_My own interpretation (after reading ChatGPT’s answer, maybe a bit influenced)_...

My original purpose with the line “pearls that were as good as dust if not worn by her” was to denote that the sole purpose in his eyes of even something as precious as a pearl is to decorate her. As ChatGPT suggests, this indicates how integrated she is in his life as a source of value.
