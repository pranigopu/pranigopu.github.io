**THE GUARDIAN SPIRIT** - _Commentary_

---

# The urban legend as told by the common people
Ísa, the guardian of the forest, was once a man who killed the brother he loved. Tormented by guilt and unable to bear what he had done, he lost his mind and began seeing his brother in everyone, everywhere. To anyone in danger, anyone hurt or humiliated by the forces of the forest, he would come to save them, to say he loved them, to vow to them that he would never hurt them again. It was as if he relived the same memory forever, seeing the same moment in every moment. That which haunted him made him the guardian of the forest, forever in atonement for a sin he could never atone for. Once he saves you, run away or he may never let go.

# In-universe perspective and commentary
Many who hear the tale believe that the guardian has suffered enough. Others feel that no suffering is enough for what he has done. But everyone understands this, that when the guardian was a man, he was not a bad one. He did not kill out of malice but out of an anger he could not control, not because anger is something that cannot be controlled, but because he had allowed himself and his self-control to wear away by taking more than he could bear and not seeking the aid and ability he needed. In this way, it is a cautionary tale to anyone who hears it.

It is widely known (at least in Kádnád) that the name of the guardian of the forest was Ísa. It is widely believed that he was a real person, although no documents of such a person exist; however, this disproves nothing as many people in his region at the time were undocumented. Nonetheless, many local expressions have arisen that make a reference to Ísa’s legend with his name. It is known that Milvus Diona (deceased) was a real, documented person, and he is the only link to Ísa’s true story, although many doubt the credibility of Milvus’s accounts, citing his trauma as a reason for doubt. Milvus also never revealed the details about Ísa’s past beyond the scope of the story, not even revealing the place where he, his grandmother (also undocumented) or any older relatives (unknown) used to live.
