**HUSK** - _Commentary_

---

To test the clarity of my writing, I asked ChatGPT to interpret it. Here are some excerpts of ChatGPT’s interpretation that I found quite insightful:

- “The imagery of the protagonist's transformation, from a dry husk of a human being to a bleeding, gasping newborn, is both visceral and symbolic. It represents a rebirth of sorts, as the protagonist finally confronts the reality of their own humanity and the pain and fear that accompany it.”
- “The protagonist's face, now devoid of life, is depicted as contorted in intense pain and primal fear. This imagery suggests that in their final moments, the protagonist is finally able to fully experience the depth of human emotion that they had been devoid of throughout their life. The pain and fear they feel in this moment are described as “life-giving”, indicating that these emotions, though agonising, are paradoxically affirming the protagonist's humanity and vitality in a way that their previous existence had not.”

My own interpretations of the above parts of the text when writing them were (note that I am writing them retrospectively after having read ChatGPT’s interpretations, trying to retrace the steps of my thinking during my writing process; my interpretation may be influenced by ChatGPT’s to some extent, but my aim is to clarify the themes and maybe rework my writing to make them clearer if necessary):

- Flesh, blood and organs are used to concretise the vitality of the spirit, so the lack of them represents the lack or loss of such vitality, while the presence of them represents that such vitality was regained in some form. “Vitality of the spirit” is — at its most basic — the state of being able to sustain one’s life and seeing one’s life as worth sustaining, which is integral to one’s volitional existence. With the narrative, I aim to concretise the idea that immorality is self-destructive first and foremost, i.e. anti-life to oneself, as much or more to the perpetrator than to the victim (if a victim exists). With how much of himself the protagonist has destroyed through his immorality, regaining his vitality is deadly to him due to cause-and-effect, as seen when he finally experiences the effects of his self-destruction to the full when he ceases to evade reality. However, note that evasion is even worse as it is a fate worse than death, a living death, i.e. the torture of decay without the release of death. For this reason, the protagonist — when faced with the emptiness of the only source of value in reality, i.e. his own existence — is desperate for some form of life beyond that of a living death, even if it would be deadly to him and last only for a few moments.
- Describing “sheer pain” and “primal fear” as feelings  “more life-giving than any he had felt for many, many cycles” was a way to show two things: (1) the horror of the hollow existence he had brought upon himself, and (2) the fact that “life-giving” and the pursuit of life and happiness as a whole is not just about the enjoyable aspects of life but the full, true experience of it without evasion.

The repeating line “How long since I looked into a mirror? My face is not what I remember it to be” is meant not just as a hook or reference to progress the narrative but also as a means to show how he tends to evade the reality in front of him, as he keeps going off into tangents until finally acknowledging the reality facing him.
