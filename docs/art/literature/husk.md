**HUSK**

**Thus spoke Šankha**...

---

How long since I looked into a mirror? My face is not what I remember it to be.

I remember the first time a part of me died to decay away, death and decay I barely felt at the time. No, how could I not have felt it? I must have felt it, surely, just as one must feel the presence of that from which averts his gaze. The man lay there, more hurt than he could take for long. No one had yet walked down the street at the time, no one but me. Oh, why me? I had thought. Why me? But as I walked by, I realised that I could avert my gaze, thinking, What is it to me? If I had not come by at all, it would have been all the same to me. So, what is it to me? And so it was. Perhaps someone else passed by and saved him. Perhaps not. What is it to me?

Ah, that scar on my cheek. I remember the time I got it, or rather, the time someone gave it to me. It was frustrating to keep her down as I pleasured myself at the expense of her pain. Pain? It must have been far more than that. I had always thought that to have been in her place would be torture, a torture of being powerless in the face of malicious, bestial intimacy with the terror of not knowing the price you were going to pay for the other’s pleasure. Yet, I had thought, what is it to me, the one taking the price and the pleasure with it. What is it to me — the strong — that the weak pay with their dignity or even their life? Who is to say they deserve dignity or life? Deserve? I had thought, “deserve”? A word that is nothing but a plea from those who cannot resist. What is it to me that they cannot resist? And so, I did my deed and did not hold back. For all that she tried, she gave me but a scar while I had left her a bloodied mass drained of life and value. I regretted that, for I wished I could have taken more before her time was up. Nonetheless, I had taken, I thought, taken and lost nothing. Yet, amid the smell of gore, I did not smell the decay of flesh I had not touched, flesh that — I realise now — was mine. Or, perhaps the stench had so pervaded my life that I sensed it no longer. No, I must have sensed it, surely, just as one must sense the old rot in the floorboards of his house.

How long since I looked into a mirror? My face is not what I remember it to be. Oh, but what an ornate mirror it is, just a drop of my wealth! My wealth? Of course it is mine, I took it did I not? I took it and gave favours, favours I could not give if I did not threaten to take away something dearer. I took what I needed and took what I wanted, taking at times more than others could give. Greedy, people have called me. Yet, why do I feel about as greedy as one who slits open his stomach to gorge more slop? Materialistic, people have called me. Yet, why do I feel about as materialistic as one who has reduced his orchard to sawdust? Why? Can I not get whatever money can buy? Then why? Why is it all sawdust to me, like the putrid sawdust that oozes out of my own orifices? 

How long since I looked into a mirror? My face is not what I remember it to be. Where are the eyes I am seeing from? Let me touch my face. Why can I feel no flesh in my cheek, no blood in my veins? Ah, a sweet! Surely, its taste must bring back something in me. Yet, it goes into me like a stone into a well. Ah, my wife! Surely, the sight of her must bring back something in me. Yet, I see in her what I see in myself. Where are the eyes she is seeing from? Let me touch her. Why can I feel no flesh in her cheek, no blood in her veins? She smiles, yet I know it only because that is how I would look if I tried to smile. Of course, I suppose it is only right that it is so, for she chose me for what I am. How long has she been like this, and how long have I? Why did I never see it? No, I must have seen it, just as one sees that which he tries to avoid.

**And so, many cycles went by, and in time, Šankha was on his deathbed**...

---

He felt his life ebbing away. All these cycles, he had always held on to it with a base, beastly aversion to death, an aversion he could not let go, held as if by a desire for life he could not feel. I cannot die, he thought, as dust trickled from where his eyes should have been, I must not die. A feeble yet firm desperation gripped him as it had for many, many cycles, but this time, it was not so feeble. Death finally at his doorstep, the desperation gripped him so hard it made him convulse. I cannot die, he repeated, as his life ebbed ever further away, I must not die.

A question was forced out of him in spasms, a question he had never been able to answer: why must I not die? He grasped his arms, holding himself against his fits. No pulse ran in his dry flesh, the very flesh meant to let him feel life with all its pleasures and pains. He grasped his face, at the eyes that were not there, the eyes meant to let him see and know all that life had to offer. No breath left his nostrils, only dust, dust he had once found putrid. Why must I not die? Why not, he thought in vain, since his whole existence, all that he ever had and ever could have — all of it was worth nothing. Nothing? How can it all be nothing? It must be something, anything. Anything!

It was then that had his answer at long last. He had to be alive for once, alive enough to die, to die truly. He had to make even a moment of his existence more than the void to which he had spent a lifetime feeding his flesh. Selfish, people had called him. Yet how could he be, if he had no self? For once, he cried to himself, for once, let me be selfish. Upon yet again feeling the dust trickle out of him, the accursed dust that marked his every waking moment, he let out a wail, a wail so ghastly for what he had been and for what he had become. He wailed for the life he never knew, for the joy he never felt and for the wealth he never had. He wailed as the trickling dust turned to water, then blood. The nurses watched with horror as he bled from his new eyes, the whites turning red. They rushed with panic as he gasped for new breaths, drowning. His pulse returned to burst his dry flesh apart, spurting out of him in a frenetic, frantic rhythm. He wailed as he gurgled and gasped, a mutilated, malformed newborn.

With one last cry, he breathed his last, his now-lifeless face contorted in sheer pain and primal fear, feelings more life-giving than any he had felt in many, many cycles. The nurses cursed as they lifted his bloodied mass of a body off the sheets, cursing how heavy it had become. His body was carried away to be buried and soon, his corpse became a feast to worms. The worms, if they could, would perhaps be the only ones to bless him.
