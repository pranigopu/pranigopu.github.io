**THE GUARDIAN SPIRIT**

_This is the story behind the legend of the guardian spirit of Kádnád._

“Vasu!” cried out Vasu’s older brother, Ísa, “You left your lunch!” <br>
Vasu raced to snatch the lunchbox from his brother’s hand. Without a word, he ran back to his friends. “He always forgets!” said Ísa, shaking his head. He looked at Vasu as he walked with his friends, chatting cheerily about who knows what. Ísa smiled, if somewhat wistfully. Then, slowly, he went back into the house and shut the door behind him. The start of another long day, he thought, trying to muster some cheer for the cheerless work ahead. Tidying up the place along with the books, papers and pens his brother had left lying around, he picked his own lunchbox and left to work.

“Oh, there you are, Ísa!” said the old woman outside her bakery, “Grab a bite before work, I’ve got a fresh batch of goodies ready to go!” <br>
Ísa smiled, “You’re very kind, but I’ve just had my meal.” <br>
“I don’t believe you! Look how lean you’ve become! Just wait a minute, I’ll give it to you for half-price. Take it, for my sake!” <br>
Ísa laughed and sighed, nodding. As the woman hobbled into the bakery, her grandson, a small, shy boy, peeked out. “Hey Ísa!” the boy greeted, beaming. “Milvus! What’re you baking for me?” <br>
“Nothing,” Milvus said, giggling. <br>
Ísa poked him softly on his nose, making the boy burst into more giggles. <br>
“Milvus!” called his grandmother, “Hold this for me, will you?” <br>
Milvus ran inside. In a minute, the old woman hobbled out, handing Ísa a bag of freshly-made sandwiches; it smelt divine. <br>
“You’re too kind, I’d like to pay you in full.” <br>
“You can pay me by eating up!” snapped the woman. <br>
Ísa smiled, paying her the half-price and thanking her as he walked away. <br>

The work in the warehouse was tedious, but at least it paid enough. Just enough for two. The hours felt longer than they were, but at some point, the zenith arrived. Ísa and the first-half shift workers then headed out, some going home, others to hang-outs, yet others, like Ísa, to after-zenith schools. He did not want to stay a warehouse worker forever, after all. Silent amid the after-work chitchat, Ísa walked with a few others to school. He had few friends and no enemies; he felt he had time for neither. He was neither happy nor sad; he felt he was too weary for either. Weary he often was, weary and maybe more than a bit lonely. The brightest part of his life for a long time had been his younger brother, even if now, this bright part seemed colder, more distant. Sure, these days, he wore him out a bit – maybe more than a bit. But he’s just trying to live his life the best he can, Ísa thought, right now, he needs a parent more than a brother.

I may be weary, thought Ísa, but I’m strong, strong enough for the both of us. The kindness of others warmed his heart, but he did not want to rely on it too much. I’m strong enough for the both of us, he repeated. He was strong to be sure, from his limbs to his will, though he was indeed becoming a bit too lean. He opened the bakery bag, picked a sandwich and took a bite. It was amazing. No matter, I’ll get my break soon.

“Get ready to eat, I’ll heat up the stew.” <br>
“Oh, I’ve already eaten.” <br>
“What? But I’d told you we had to finish the stew before it goes bad!” <br>
“I forgot.” <br>
“I can’t eat all of this, I’ve got to throw so much away!” <br>
“I forgot, sorry.” <br>
“Sorry? Isn’t that too handy.” <br>
Vasu gave his brother a dirty look, “What else can I say? Find some beggar to feed, if you care so much.” Ísa was furious, but said nothing. It’s just a bit of food, he tried to tell himself, a waste to be sure, but not worth losing my cool over. He put the pot on the stove and turned on the heat. <br>
“Where did you go today?” <br>
“Just went with my friends.” <br>
“Yes, but where? What did you do?” <br>
Vasu looked up, annoyed, “Can we not talk now? I’m very tired.” <br>
“You’re tired? Of what, roaming with your friends?” <br>
Vasu gave Ísa a glare, but said nothing. <br>
“Listen Vasu, you’re still a kid. I just want to know what you’ve been up to, like any parent would. I mean, I’m not a parent, but –” <br>
“Yes, you’re not. Please don’t try to be.” <br>
Ísa resented this remark, but pushed, “Is something bothering you?” <br>
“Yes, you.” <br>
“Did you have a bad day?” <br>
“It’s always fine until I come here.” <br>
“Here? You mean your home?” <br>
“I mean where you are, like some bug, always bugging me.” <br>
“How dare you!” <br>
Vasu groaned, “Let’s just leave each other alone, shall we? We’d be happier for it. At least I’d be, I don’t know about you or whatever’s itching you.” <br>
“That’s enough!” <br>
“I agree.” <br>
Ísa’s heart was pounding. “You’ve gone too far. I tolerate your mess, your irresponsibility, your... your...” <br>
“Just stop before you have a seizure.” <br>
Ísa burst into a rage. Without thinking, without even seeing what he was doing, he swung his fists. He was not sure how it all happened, only that it did, only that one moment his brother stood before him, the next he was on the floor, bloodied and lifeless, bloodied and lifeless by his hands. His hands. His brother. “No,” he said, dazed. He bent down to lift the body off the floor, to take in his arms what was once the brightest part of his life. “You know I love you,” he said softly, in a stupor, “I’ll never hurt you again.” <br>



The next day, Milvus knocked at Ísa’s door. His grandmother had made a new kind of pie, tastier than anything she had made before. Milvus was eager to share this with Ísa and his brother. They’ll really like this! The door opened. There stood Ísa, cloak wrapped around him. <br>
“Hey Ísa!” the boy greeted, beaming as he always did when he met him.
Ísa looked at him. Milvus took a step back. The eyes had a glazed look, awake but not quite. “Are... are you okay, Ísa?” <br>
“Yes.” <br>
Milvus handed him the basket, “This… this is for you and your brother.” <br>
“You’re too kind, I’d like to pay you in full.” <br>
“Oh… no… no need. It’s a gift.” <br>
Ísa smiled at him. At least, he smiled in his direction. At least, his face resembled a smile, almost enough to call it a smile. Milvus took another step back. “I’ll… I’ll see you later. Bye.” He turned away and walked as fast as he could, not sure why we felt so shaken. He did not look back and kept walking, almost breaking into a run, close to tripping but not daring to slow down. When he reached the busy street, he looked back. Ísa’s door was shut. I’m being silly, he thought, of course I am. It was the last time he saw Ísa in town.



Twenty cycles had passed since the news. For Milvus, to whom the world had always been a bit of a terrifying place, it also became a much darker one. For the rest of her days, his grandmother withdrew, as if she had lost a dear son. However, with time, Milvus became older, a bit wiser and a bit stronger. The world never felt bright again, but he learnt to live with it. He had to.

One day, Milvus was travelling through the forest near his town. His district was immersed in forests, hence its name, Kádnád, the “forest country”. Some were dangerous due to the beasts, others due to the bandits, but most were safe. Milvus was lost, not sure anymore which kind of forest he was in. He felt his dagger in its sheath around his belt. The common man’s weapon, he thought to himself, I’d feel better with a handgun. He just hoped he would come across one of the forest towns he had heard of, hopefully sooner than later. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best, he thought to himself.

The worst came to pass. In a blink of an eye, he was surrounded by four men, their attire shabby and their eyes hungry. Their faces were veiled in the same shabby cloth as their clothes, just well enough to be worth the effort. Three of them had drawn out their short swords – or long daggers? The fourth held a handgun in his hand, an old, rickety thing that barely looked like it worked. <br>
“Don’t try anything, lad,” said one of them. <br>
“Just give us what we ask, nice and easy.” <br>
Milvus was shaking, but his voice was calm, “I’ll give you all I have.” <br>
“All of it, we will check.” <br>
First, Milvus pulled out his wallet, then his food, then his set of spare clothes, then his shoes. Finally, he took off the dagger with its sheath. “What were you going to do with that?” laughed one of them. <br>
“That’s all of it.” <br>
One bandit checked his bag, another his coat pockets. <br>
“Empty, good. That’s a nice coat.” <br>
“You’re right,” said the one with the handgun, “that is a nice coat.” <br>
He gestured at Milvus to take it off, which he did. <br>
“Alright, what do we do with him?” <br>
“He hasn’t seen our faces — we don’t need to kill him.” <br>
“Yeah, we kill too many and Mistress Law’s gonna get nasty.” <br>
“We don’t want to scare people into arming up either.” <br>
The one with the handgun said, “Yes yes, let him go, who knows how long he’ll last out here like this anyway. Nights get chilly, too. Also,” he said, his veil not hiding his smirk, “He must be lost. No one dares travel here on foot.” <br>
The men snickered, sheathing their blades. <br>
“Off you go,” said the one with the handgun. <br>
Still trembling, Milvus walked on, humiliated, despair setting in. Suddenly, he heard a blow, then a slash, then a stab. He whirled around to see a haggard, half-crazed man tearing apart the bandits. He had with him but a razor, his fists, and his teeth. Milvus watched, transfixed, as one by one, the bandits dropped to the floor, dead or bleeding to death. The one with the handgun pulled the trigger again and again in haste, but his weapon was as useless as it looked. Soon, there were none standing, none save for the haggard, half-crazed man. Milvus backed away but did not run. Something about the man was familiar, familiar enough to stop him.

In a burst, the man ran up to him and wrapped his arms around him in an embrace. “You know I love you,” the man said softly, in a stupor, “I’ll never hurt you again.” Milvus’ eyes widened. The man let go. Milvus could see the face, the eyes, the eyes that had a glazed look, awake but not quite. Twenty cycles of pain came crashing, flooding Milvus’ eyes. The man he adored was long gone, his words were not meant for him and his eyes did not see him. Seeing this mask of a face of a man once so dear was more than Milvus could bear. He turned and ran, ran as fast as he could, as far as he could.

The sun began to set. Milvus had stopped running but had not stopped. He kept walking until he realised how tired he was. He slowed down and, half-unwilling, turned back. In the distance, on a hill and amongst draped stalks and trees, he spotted the lone figure of a man, as still as the stalks around him. What do I feel, Milvus thought, anger, hatred… pity? What do you feel for a ghost? In a burst of pain, he thought, maybe this is what he deserves.

In the distance, a town began to light up, an island of light in the growing darkness. It’s not too far away, he said to himself. He wondered what he would say to the people he met when they asked him what happened. He was not sure; maybe he would just tell the truth. He looked back toward the lone figure in the distance. Maybe he would just tell some of the truth, spin a story out of it, a story that, if he believed it enough, might let him sleep a little better at night.

# Additional in-universe lore
## The urban legend as told by the common people
Ísa, the guardian of the forest, was once a man who killed the brother he loved. Tormented by guilt and unable to bear what he had done, he lost his mind and began seeing his brother in everyone, everywhere. To anyone in danger, anyone hurt or humiliated by the forces of the forest, he would come to save them, to say he loved them, to vow to them that he would never hurt them again. It was as if he relived the same memory forever, seeing the same moment in every moment. That which haunted him made him the guardian of the forest, forever in atonement for a sin he could never atone for. Once he saves you, run away or he may never let go.

## In-universe perspective and commentary
Many who hear the tale believe that the guardian has suffered enough. Others feel that no suffering is enough for what he has done. But everyone understands this, that when the guardian was a man, he was not a bad one. He did not kill out of malice but out of an anger he could not control, not because anger is something that cannot be controlled, but because he had allowed himself and his self-control to wear away by taking more than he could bear and not seeking the aid and ability he needed. In this way, it is a cautionary tale to anyone who hears it.

It is widely known (at least in Kádnád) that the name of the guardian of the forest was Ísa. It is widely believed that he was a real person, although no documents of such a person exist; however, this disproves nothing as many people in his region at the time were undocumented. Nonetheless, many local expressions have arisen that make a reference to Ísa’s legend with his name. It is known that Milvus Diona (deceased) was a real, documented person, and he is the only link to Ísa’s true story, although many doubt the credibility of Milvus’s accounts, citing his trauma as a reason for doubt. Milvus also never revealed the details about Ísa’s past beyond the scope of the story, not even revealing the place where he, his grandmother (also undocumented) or any older relatives (unknown) used to live.
