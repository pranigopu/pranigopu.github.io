# Poetry
## Introduction
Poetry is a form of literature that uses the musical qualities of language (e.g. rhythm, rhyme, stress, etc.). One of my main aims in poetry is to encapsulate important ideas in a memorable, pleasurable manner. I have included my own poems as well as my favourite poems of others.
