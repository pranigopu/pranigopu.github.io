_A collection of poems (or poem excerpts) from other poets that I enjoyed and wanted to save._

# The Arrow and the Song <br> _by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_
I shot an arrow into the air, <br>
It fell to earth, I knew not where; <br>
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight <br>
Could not follow it in its flight.

I breathed a song into the air, <br>
It fell to earth, I knew not where; <br>
For who has sight so keen and strong, <br>
That it can follow the flight of song?

Long, long afterward, in an oak <br>
I found the arrow, still unbroke; <br>
And the song, from beginning to end, <br>
I found again in the heart of a friend.

# Dying Speech of an Old Philosopher <br> _by Walter Savage Landor_
I strove with none, for none was worth my strife: <br>
Nature I loved, and, next to Nature, Art: <br>
I warm’d both hands before the fire of Life; <br>
It sinks; and I am ready to depart.

# Snippets from “Ulysses” <br> _by Alfred Tennyson_
_(To clarify, “Ulysses” is the name of the whole poem)_

I am a part of all that I have met; <br>
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro’ <br>
Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades <br>
For ever and forever when I move. <br>
How dull it is to pause, to make an end, <br>
To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use! <br>
As tho’ to breathe were life! Life piled on life <br>
Were all too little, and of one to me <br>
Little remains: but every hour is saved <br>
From that eternal silence, something more, <br>
A bringer of new things; and vile it were <br>
For some three suns to store and hoard myself, <br>
And this gray spirit yearning in desire <br>
To follow knowledge like a sinking star, <br>
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: <br>
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, <br>
Souls that have toil’d, and wrought, and thought with me— <br>
That ever with a frolic welcome took <br>
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed <br>
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old; <br>
Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; <br>
Death closes all: but something ere the end, <br>
Some work of noble note, may yet be done, <br>
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. <br>
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: <br>
The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep <br>
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, <br>
‘T is not too late to seek a newer world. <br>
Push off, and sitting well in order smite <br>
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds <br>
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths <br>
Of all the western stars, until I die. <br>
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: <br>
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, <br>
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. <br>
Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’ <br>
We are not now that strength which in old days <br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; <br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts, <br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will <br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
