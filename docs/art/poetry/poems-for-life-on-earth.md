_A collection of my poems that essentialise my views on key aspects of truth, self-value and the affirmation of the facts of reality._

# On truth
## Truth and Pride
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

My mis- <br>
-takes shall not shame me, for <br>
They are steps to the light — the <br>
Truth, the source of my strength, its pur- <br>
-suit, the source of my pride. I

Relish not in my rightness, but in my <br>
Hunger for that which is right; <br>
When my acts nourish me, I’ll know <br>
Then it’s on my side.

## Philosophia
**(4 beats per line)**

I shall hate the hateful, <br>
And shall love the good, but <br>
Always shall be grateful for <br>
Having understood, for the

Fact that the world is, and that <br>
I can grasp it all, <br>
Not to ace a quiz, but to <br>
Stand proud and tall, to

Look fate in the eye, ac- <br>
-cept what is and can be, <br>
Never to pray unto the sky; the <br>
Truth is not my enemy.

## Non-evasion
**(4 beats per line)**

I fear no glimpse, no <br>
Thought, no reminder; <br>
If they bring unease, they'll <br>
Serve as my pathfinder, my

Map to what I've missed or lost or <br>
Wrongly put behind me; no <br>
Ghosts shall haunt my closet, no <br>
Delphic dread shall find me.

I fear no glimpse, no <br>
Thought, no desire; <br>
Ghastly or benign, they'll <br>
Serve to fuel my fire, <br>

The fire kept alive by the <br>
Breaths of a clear mind; no <br>
Beast shall seize my soul, no <br>
Shame shall ever bind.

# On life
## Heart of the Heart
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

I care <br>
Not for what one sees in me, I <br>
Only care to see, <br>
Not for tales in posterity, I <br>
Only care to be, to

Be and to breathe, to <br>
Savour or to weep. My <br>
Life holds no hero’s arc, for <br>
It is mine to reap.

## An Ode to the Fact of Existence
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

The pro- <br>
-faned and treasured, the pains and pleasures, <br>
All parts of the whole. My <br>
Feelings are many, in many measures, but for <br>
You? Only fire in my soul. I

Strive against plight and delight in vigour. I <br>
Curse or bless the deserving. My <br>
Verdict is stark when held with rigour, and for <br>
You? My love is unswerving.

You owe me nothing, nor I you, <br>
All I say is, “Yes, <br>
Yes, all that’s good and true is <br>
Twined in your impress.”

## The Peerless Value
**(4 beats per line)**

I can be no one else and none can be me; <br>
All that was and is are open to no plea, no <br>
Wish, no whim, no whimsical dream, for <br>
Such dreams are nothing but a dried up stream, tied up <br>
In the null, in the sheer lifeless beyond, for <br>
They shun and spurn all of which to be fond. <br>
What is, is, and what is not, is not; <br>
Such is all I need, and such is all I’ve got. I'll <br>
Seek the desirable, the parts I want as mine, but <br>
All that’s aspirable can never outshine the <br>
Whole that is me, that I am and could be. No <br>
Other’s life is mine, nor can be, nor should be.

## Wishes and Dreams
**(4 beats per line)**

The <br>
Things my heart beats for, are <br>
Of and from this world, this <br>
One, the one and only, where I <br>
Stand, not forlornly, but

Glad, in flesh and blood, no <br>
Phantoms in my veins. But <br>
If I let them in my skull, my <br>
Heart would beat for null.

**Performance note**:

The last line contains a rest such that "null" and "skull" line up rhythmically (i.e. such that both these words fall on the fourth beat). However, I leave it up to the reader or performer to decide where they want to put this rest. My personal favourites are: "Heart would beat for... null" and "Heart would beat... for null".
