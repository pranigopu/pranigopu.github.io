_A collection of my poems that essentialise my views on key aspects of truth, self-value and the affirmation of the facts of reality._

# Prologue
_Most treasured is the next breath,_ <br>
_Null without the breath of now._ <br>
_Never shall we see its death;_ <br>
_That, we the living can avow._

# On truth
## Truth and Pride
**(4 beats per line; first line starts in the last beat)**

My mis- <br>
-takes shall not shame me, for <br>
They are steps to the light — the <br>
Truth, the source of my strength, its pur- <br>
-suit, the source of my pride. I

Relish not in my rightness, but in my <br>
Hunger for that which is right; <br>
When my acts nourish me, I’ll know <br>
Then it’s on my side.

## Philosophia
**(2 beats per line)**

I shall hate the hateful, <br>
And shall love the good, but <br>
Always shall be grateful for <br>
Having understood, for the

Fact that the world is, and that <br>
I can grasp it all, <br>
Not to ace a quiz, but to <br>
Stand proud and tall, to

Look fate in the eye, ac- <br>
-cept what is and can be, <br>
Never to pray unto the sky; the <br>
Truth is not my enemy.

## Non-evasion
**(2 beats per line)**

I fear no glimpse, no <br>
Thought, no reminder; <br>
If they bring unease, they'll <br>
Serve as my pathfinder, my

Map to what I've missed or lost or <br>
Wrongly put behind me; no <br>
Ghosts will haunt my closet, no <br>
Delphic dread shall find me.

I fear no glimpse, no <br>
Thought, no desire; <br>
Ghastly or benign, they'll <br>
Serve to fuel my fire,

The fire kept alive by the <br>
Breaths of a clear mind; no <br>
Beast will seize my soul, no <br>
Shame shall ever bind.

# On life
## Heart of the Heart
**(2 beats per line; first line starts in the last beat)**

I care <br>
Not for what one sees in me, I <br>
Only care to see, <br>
Not for tales in posterity, I <br>
Only care to be, to

Be and to breathe, to <br>
Savour or to weep. My <br>
Life holds no hero’s arc, for <br>
It is mine to reap.

## An Ode to the Fact of Existence
**(2 beats per line; first line is empty)**

- ...
    - The pro-
- _-faned and treasured, the_
    - _pains and pleasures,_
- All parts of the
    - whole. My
- _Feelings are many, in_
    - _many measures, but for_
- You? Only fire in my
    - soul. I <br><br>

- _Strive against plight and de-_
    - _-light in vigour. I_
- Curse or bless the de-
    - -serving. My
- _Verdict is stark when_
    - _held with rigour, and for_
- You? My love is un-
    - -swerving. <br><br>

- _You owe me nothing,_
    - _nor I you,_
- All I say is,
    - "Yes,
- _Yes, all that's_
    - _good and true is_
- Twined in your im-
    - -press."

## The Peerless Value
**(4 beats per line)**

I can be no one else and none can be me; <br>
All that was and is are open to no plea, no <br>
Wish, no whim, no whimsical dream, for <br>
Such dreams are but a dried up stream, tied up <br>
In the null, in the sheer lifeless beyond, for <br>
They shun and spurn all of which to be fond. <br>
What is, is, and what is not, is not; <br>
Such is all I need, and such is all I’ve got. I'll <br>
Seek the desirable, the parts I want as mine, but <br>
All that’s aspirable can never outshine the <br>
Whole that is me, that I am and could be. No <br>
Other’s life is mine, nor can be, nor should be.

## Wishes and Dreams
**(4 beats per line; first line starts in the last beat)**

The <br>
Things my heart beats for, are <br>
Of and from this world, this <br>
One, the one and only, where I <br>
Stand, not forlornly, but

Glad, in flesh and blood, no <br>
Phantoms in my veins. But <br>
If I let them in my skull, my <br>
Heart would beat for... null.

**NOTE**: _"Null" and "skull" line up rhythmically._

# Others
## Purpose
He throws the anchor ahead, <br>
Hitting nought but water, <br>
Splitting froth and waves, <br>
Hoping the sea behaves.

But, unmoored and adrift, <br>
Oh, the shore within sight! <br>
Yet, he stays in his plight, <br>
Ever at the mercy of the waves.

The anchor feels such a burden, <br>
Throwing it, such a pain, <br>
Yet, here he paddles in vain, <br>
Hoping the sea behaves.

May some calm not lull his heart, <br>
Into a soothing peace, <br>
Bare to fate's caprice. <br>
May his anchor harness the waves.

## Illumination
A mind greater than mine, <br>
With reason, his instrument: <br>
A tree that shades my leaves? <br>
That grows to my detriment?

No, not in this world. <br>
His might won't make me cower; <br>
For his might is not of a brute, <br>
Or a beast, or a tyrant's power.

When I delve into winding caves, <br>
Shining my own light down the rift, <br>
Mining for insight into the depths, <br>
His brightness is a gift.

I am not humbled, nothing is lessened, <br>
For my project of life is aided. <br>
Only pride and joy in my heart; <br>
My own potential is elevated.

## The Heretic
— The one asked: <br>
"Why shun the light? <br>
Why stand forsaken, <br>
In lonely fright?"

— The other replied: <br>
"Alone, not lonely. <br>
The ground below me, <br>
Is all that's holy."

## A is A
"Can I truly affirm, <br>
That this cup is here? <br>
My senses lie, I fear."

"But, what is, is. <br>
What touches you is the given, <br>
All therefrom is self-driven."

"Self-driven? Up to me? <br>
But, exist many conceptions, <br>
Among them, many deceptions"

"Self-driven is man's will. <br>
The choice to see is his, <br>
To see that what is, is."

## Eternity
Whatever was before, <br>
Whatever comes after, <br>
To be, is at the core, <br>
Of now and hereafter.
