_A collection of my poems that essentialise my views on key aspects of truth, self-value and the affirmation of the facts of reality._

# On truth
## Truth and Pride
**(4 beats per line; first line starts in the last beat)**

- My mis-
- -takes shall not shame me, for
- They are steps to the light — the
- Truth, the source of my strength, its pur-
- -suit, the source of my pride. I <br><br>

- Relish not in my rightness, but in my
- Hunger for that which is right;
- When my acts nourish me, I’ll know
- Then it’s on my side.

## Philosophia
**(2 beats per line)**

- I shall hate the hateful,
- And shall love the good, but
- Always shall be grateful for
- Having understood, for the <br><br>

- Fact that the world is, and that
- I can grasp it all,
- Not to ace a quiz, but to
- Stand proud and tall, to <br><br>

- Look fate in the eye, ac-
- -cept what is and can be,
- Never to pray unto the sky; the
- Truth is not my enemy.

## Non-evasion
**(2 beats per line)**

- I fear no glimpse, no
- Thought, no reminder;
- If they bring unease, they'll
- Serve as my pathfinder, my <br><br>

- Map to what I've missed or lost or
- Wrongly put behind me; no
- Ghosts will haunt my closet, no
- Delphic dread shall find me. <br><br>

- I fear no glimpse, no
- Thought, no desire;
- Ghastly or benign, they'll
- Serve to fuel my fire, <br><br>

- The fire kept alive by the
- Breaths of a clear mind; no
- Beast will seize my soul, no
- Shame shall ever bind.

# On life
## Heart of the Heart
**(2 beats per line; first line starts in the last beat)**

- I care
- Not for what one sees in me, I
- Only care to see,
- Not for tales in posterity, I
- Only care to be, to <br><br>

- Be and to breathe, to
- Savour or to weep. My
- Life holds no hero’s arc, for
- It is mine to reap.
- 
## An Ode to the Fact of Existence
**(2 beats per line; first line is empty)**

- ...
    - The pro-
- -faned and treasured, the
    - pains and pleasures,
- All parts of the
    - whole. My
- Feelings are many, in
    - many measures, but for
- You? Only fire in my
    - soul. I <br><br>

- Strive against plight and de-
    - -light in vigour. I
- Curse or bless the de-
    - -serving. My
- Verdict is stark when
    - held with rigour, and for
- You? My love is un-
    - -swerving. <br><br>

- You owe me nothing,
    - nor I you,
- All I say is,
    - “Yes,
- Yes, all that’s
    - good and true is
- Twined in your im-
    - -press.”

## The Peerless Value
**(4 beats per line)**

- I can be no one else and none can be me;
- All that was and is are open to no plea, no
- Wish, no whim, no whimsical dream, for
- Such dreams are but a dried up stream, tied up
- In the null, in the sheer lifeless beyond, for
- They shun and spurn all of which to be fond.
- What is, is, and what is not, is not;
- Such is all I need, and such is all I’ve got. I'll
- Seek the desirable, the parts I want as mine, but
- All that’s aspirable can never outshine the
- Whole that is me, that I am and could be. No
- Other’s life is mine, nor can be, nor should be.

## Wishes and Dreams
**(4 beats per line; first line starts in the last beat)**

- The
- Things my heart beats for, are
- Of and from this world, this
- One, the one and only, where I
- Stand, not forlornly, but <br><br>

- Glad, in flesh and blood, no
- Phantoms in my veins. But
- If I let them in my skull, my
- Heart would beat for... null.

**NOTE**: _"Null" and "skull" line up rhythmically._
