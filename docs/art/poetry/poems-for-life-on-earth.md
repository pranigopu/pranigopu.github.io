_A collection of my poems that essentialise my views on key aspects of truth, self-value and the affirmation of the facts of reality._

# Truth and Pride
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

My mis- <br>
-takes shall not shame me, for <br>
They are steps to the light — the <br>
Truth, the source of my strength, its pur- <br>
-suit, the source of my pride. I

Relish not in my rightness, but in my <br>
Hunger for that which is right; <br>
When my acts nourish me, I’ll know <br>
Then it’s on my side.

# Heart of the Heart
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

I care <br>
Not for what one sees in me, I <br>
Only care to see, <br>
Not for tales in posterity, I <br>
Only care to be, to

Be and to breathe, to <br>
Savour or to weep. My <br>
Life holds no hero’s arc, for <br>
It is mine to reap.

# Philosophia
**(4 beats per line)**

I shall hate the hateful, <br>
And shall love the good, but <br>
Always shall be grateful for <br>
Having understood, for the

Fact that the world is, and that <br>
I can grasp it all, <br>
Not to ace a quiz, but to <br>
Stand proud and tall, to

Look fate in the eye, ac- <br>
-cept what is and can be, <br>
Never to pray unto the sky; the <br>
Truth is not my enemy.

# An Ode to the Fact of Existence
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

The pro- <br>
-faned and treasured, the pains and pleasures, <br>
All parts of the whole. My <br>
Feelings are many, in many measures, but for <br>
You? Only fire in my soul. I

Strive against plight and delight in vigour. I <br>
Curse or bless the deserving. My <br>
Verdict is stark when held with rigour, and for <br>
You? My love is unswerving.

You owe me nothing, nor I you, <br>
All I say is, “Yes, <br>
Yes, all that’s good and true is <br>
Twined in your impress.”

# The Peerless Value
**(4 beats per line)**

I can be no one else and none can be me; <br>
All that was and is are open to no plea, no <br>
Wish, no whim, no whimsical dream, for <br>
Such dreams are nothing but a dried up stream, tied up <br>
In the null, in the sheer lifeless beyond, for <br>
They shun and spurn all of which to be fond. <br>
What is, is, and what is not, is not; <br>
Such is all I need, and such is all I’ve got. I'll <br>
Seek the desirable, the parts I want as mine, but <br>
All that’s aspirable can never outshine the <br>
Whole that is me, that I am and could be. No <br>
Other’s life is mine, nor can be, nor should be.
