# Truth and Pride
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

My mis-
-takes shall not shame me, for
They are steps to the light — the
Truth, the source of my strength, its pur-
-suit, the source of my pride. I

Relish not in my rightness, but in my
Hunger for that which is right;
When my acts nourish me, I’ll know
Then it’s on my side.

# Heart of the Heart
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

I care
Not for what one sees in me, I
Only care to see,
Not for tales in posterity, I
Only care to be, to

Be and to breathe, to
Savour or to weep. My
Life holds no hero’s arc, for
It is mine to reap.

# Philosophia
**(4 beats per line)**

I shall hate the hateful,
And shall love the good, but
Always shall be grateful for
Having understood, for the

Fact that the world is, and that
I can grasp it all,
Not to ace a quiz, but to
Stand proud and tall, to

Look fate in the eye, ac-
-cept what is and can be,
Never to pray unto the sky; the
Truth is not my enemy.

# Cosmophilia: An Ode to the Fact of Existence
**(4 beats per line; starting line starts at the last beat)**

The pro-
-faned and the treasured, the pains and the pleasures,
All parts of the whole. My
Feelings are many, in many measures, but for
You? Only fire in my soul. I

Strive against plight and delight in vigour. I
Curse or bless the deserving. My
Verdict is stark when held with rigour, and for
You? My love is unswerving.

You owe me nothing, nor I you,
All I say is, “Yes,
Yes, all that’s good and true is
Twined in your impress.”

# The Peerless Value
**(4 beats per line)**

I can be no one else and none can be me;
All that was and is are open to no plea, no
Wish, no whim, no whimsical dream, for
Such dreams are nothing but a dried up stream, tied up
In the null, in the sheer lifeless beyond, for
They shun and spurn all of which to be fond.
What is, is, and what is not, is not;
Such is all I need, and such is all I’ve got. I'll
Seek the desirable, the parts I want as mine, but
All that’s aspirable can never outshine the
Whole that is me, that I am and could be. No
Other’s life is mine, nor can be, nor should be.
