_A collection of poems to capture some specific aspects of the self, life and the world that I cherish._

# Sparks to Fire, Fire to Warmth
**(4 beats per line)**

Sparks from a stream, in a
Dream come true, the
Current not nearly con-
-tained in you; you
Aren’t really in
Pain, are you?

Crying for release, yet
Trying to hold onto it, de-
-nying its decrease, while
Dying to be its conduit, your
Heart so replete with de-
-sire to respond to it. The

Fire will deplete, but its
Warmth will overtake, washing
Over every ache, sloshing
Lively, in your soul, not
Spirited sparks, but rays of gold; dis-
-may or cold… can’t sway… its… hold.

# Pale Grey Sky
**(4 beats per line, first line starting at the last beat)**

Look
Up and see the pale sky,
And the merging damp clouds, with
Birds soaring so high,
Yet below the sombre shrouds. The

Day was full of brewing promise
Though a bit drab and cold; if
Grey turned blue, all would miss the
Rain the clouds foretold.

# The Greatest Gift
**(4 beats per line)**

Lo and behold! Here’s the world before you. It e-
-xisted before & will persist beyond you. No-
-thing’s apart from it; even you’re a part of it, even
If you feel, perhaps, that you’re the start of it. You

See all around you that things are what they are,
Everything that is, from the rock to the star.
All things abound, there is much that surrounds, but
You can grasp that which leads to thoughts profound, the

Essence, the abstraction, the algebra of knowledge, the
Means whereby you’d more than just perceive & allege, the
Means whereby you’d know the many from the one, grasp
The plurality of all things under the sun,

Bring the infinite into the range of perception,
In a single word hold an immense conception.
This is the one great gift of humanity,
Learn so you may flourish, not fall into insanity.

# Freedom
**(4 beats per line, first line starting at the last beat)**

She
Stands, not weak nor withered, from the a-
-byss of despair she’s delivered. A
Storm rages outside, yet in her
Eyes is something fiercer: de-
-fiance in her being, as if no
Pain should dare to pierce her. Her

Withheld expression couldn’t
Hold back her radiance, wouldn’t
Hold back the joy, the furious
Joy coursing through her veins, her
Posture, still and steady, as if to
Keep her hold over the reins.

All my pity’s vaporised;
Such a being deserves none. No
Feeling so pathetic for a
Living drop of the sun! Her
Grey tunic is but a wisp of a
Cloud coming undone. “I’m

Free,” she says quietly, but I
Can’t imagine otherwise, as if
This were an axiom, that from her
Being one would surmise. Is
This the bloom of volition, that in
Myself I could realise?

# Motorised Locomotion
**(4 beats per line, first line starting at the last beat)**

The
Forces of nature harnessed and controlled, the
Fiery potential of ancient fuels rea-
-lised and released into closed chambers, cre-
-ating bursts of motion woven
Into a circle, whose movement unfolds
Onto the path, taking me on and a-
-way in an unswerving ray,
Heavy as boulder yet fast as the wind.

The
Forces of nature harnessed and controlled, the
Cold, dead matter given a life,
Given a form exuding purpose,
Glorious purpose to move, to hold and pro-
-pel itself with power and poise, to
Carry with it its precious load, to
Carry lives, minds and matter,
Dangerously fast, yet safe in its grasp.
