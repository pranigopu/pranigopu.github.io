# Sparks to Fire, Fire to Warmth
**(4 beats per line)**

Sparks from a stream, in a <br>
Dream come true, the <br>
Current not nearly con- <br>
-tained in you; you <br>
Aren’t really in <br>
Pain, are you?

Crying for release, yet <br>
Trying to hold onto it, de- <br>
-nying its decrease, while <br>
Dying to be its conduit, your <br>
Heart so replete with de- <br>
-sire to respond to it. The

Fire will deplete, but its <br>
Warmth will overtake, washing <br>
Over every ache, sloshing <br>
Lively, in your soul, not <br>
Spirited sparks, but rays of gold; dis- <br>
-may or cold… can’t sway… its… hold.

# Pale Grey Sky
**(4 beats per line, first line starting at the last beat)**

Look <br>
Up and see the pale sky, <br>
And the merging damp clouds, with <br>
Birds soaring so high, <br>
Yet below the sombre shrouds. The

Day was full of brewing promise <br>
Though a bit drab and cold; if <br>
Grey turned blue, all would miss the <br>
Rain the clouds foretold.

# The Greatest Gift
**(4 beats per line)**

Lo and behold! Here’s the world before you. It e- <br>
-xisted before and will persist beyond you. No- <br>
-thing’s apart from it; even you’re a part of it, even <br>
If you feel, perhaps, that you’re the start of it. You

See all around you that things are what they are, <br>
Everything that is, from the rock to the star. <br>
All things abound, there is much that surrounds, but <br>
You can grasp that which leads to thoughts profound, the

Essence, the abstraction, the algebra of knowledge, the <br>
Means whereby you’d more than just perceive and allege, the <br>
Means whereby you’d know the many from the one, grasp <br>
The plurality of all things under the sun,

Bring the infinite into the range of perception, <br>
In a single word hold an immense conception. <br>
This is the one great gift of humanity, <br>
Learn so you may flourish, not fall into insanity.

# Freedom
**(4 beats per line, first line starting at the last beat)**

She <br>
Stands, not weak nor withered, from the a- <br>
-byss of despair she’s delivered. A <br>
Storm rages outside, yet in her <br>
Eyes is something fiercer: de- <br>
-fiance in her being, as if no <br>
Pain should dare to pierce her. Her

Withheld expression couldn’t <br>
Hold back her radiance, wouldn’t <br>
Hold back the joy, the furious <br>
Joy coursing through her veins, her <br>
Posture, still and steady, as if to <br>
Keep her hold over the reins.

All my pity’s vaporised; <br>
Such a being deserves none. No <br>
Feeling so pathetic for a <br>
Living drop of the sun! Her <br>
Grey tunic is but a wisp of a <br>
Cloud coming undone. “I’m

Free,” she says quietly, but I <br>
Can’t imagine otherwise, as if <br>
This were an axiom, that from her <br>
Being one would surmise. Is <br>
This the bloom of volition, that in <br>
Myself I could realise?

# Motorised Locomotion
**(4 beats per line, first line starting at the last beat)**

The <br>
Forces of nature harnessed and controlled, the <br>
Fiery potential of ancient fuels rea- <br>
-lised and released into closed chambers, cre- <br>
-ating bursts of motion woven <br>
Into a circle, whose movement unfolds <br>
Onto the path, taking me on and a- <br>
-way in an unswerving ray, <br>
Heavy as boulder yet fast as the wind.

The <br>
Forces of nature harnessed and controlled, the <br>
Cold, dead matter given a life, <br>
Given a form exuding purpose, <br>
Glorious purpose to move, to hold and pro- <br>
-pel itself with power and poise, to <br>
Carry with it its precious load, to <br>
Carry lives, minds and matter, <br>
Dangerously fast, yet safe in its grasp.
