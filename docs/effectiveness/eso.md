# Defining the terms
## Essentialisation
Essentialisation is the process of identifying the essential characteristics in an object of focus (e.g. an entity, a person, a project, a subject, etc.). Given a purposeful context (i.e. a context involving one or more purposes), the essential characteristics of an object of focus are the smallest set of its characteristics that together integrate (i.e. causally and/or logically necessitate) everything within your context that affects or can potentially affect the pursuit of your purposes.

**NOTE: Arbitrary claims and irrelevant considerations**:

Note that to claim that something can potentially affect your pursuit, there must be evidence for it, not merely a lack of evidence against it; if only the latter holds and not the former, then the claim is an arbitrary claim. Note also that if the effect of something on the pursuit of your purposes does not change your ability to pursue them, as per your knowledge and within your context, then it is an irrelevant consideration. By contrast, the essentials, being the causal and/or logical basis of the purposeful context, are the most relevant considerations.

_For more on evidence, arbitrary claims and irrelevant considerations, see_: ["Identifying evidence" from _Knowledge and Certainty_ from **Epistemology** from **Philosophy**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/epistemology/knowledge-and-certainty.html).

## Simplification
Simplification is the process of omitting irrelevant or less relevant details so as to sharpen the focus on what is most relevant within a purposeful context. The need for simplification arises from the finite capacity of consciousness. To elaborate, in order to consider something as per the context, you must be able to hold this context in focus. However, to do so, you must be able to sufficiently condense this context to let it fit into your focus while also letting you take in other considerations.

Now, we can see why irrelevant or less relevant details must be omitted to simplify. To be able to take in other considerations based on what is most relevant at a given time, and to be able to work on these considerations (which may have their own complexities to deal with), we must sufficiently clarify our focus. This often needs the omission of details, and logically, it is the details that are irrelevant, least relevant or that would become relevant at a later time that must be omitted.

## Organisation
Organisation is the process of ordering a set of items (e.g. objects, topics, tasks, etc.) based on some kind of logical relationship. A logical relationship is the identification of one or more mutual characteristics between items. For example, a causal relationship between entities is the identification of a mutual interactivity between the two entities, a hierarchical relationship between concepts is the identification of one concept's referents as a subset of the other's (thus having mutual identities on some level), a categorical relationship between two topics is the identification of shared essential characteristics that unite them into a broader topic (thus having a mutual genus), etc.

A set of items ordered based on some kind of logical relationship lets us consider the items in a logical progression. For example, organising tasks based on relevance to a goal lets us consider items from the most to the least relevant, organising topics based on the hierarchy of their concepts lets us consider them based on how one builds on the other (making sure we always have what we need to understand each topic), etc.

# Relating the above
To pursue a purpose effectively, we must organise both knowledge and objectives based on relevance and complexity. To do so, we must first essentialise the purposeful context to reach the essentials and thus the logical relationships between various parts of the context. Then, we must simplify our considerations in order to apply our focus on each one effectively. Finally, we must organise our considerations so that we can progress with them effectively. Hence, essentialisation, simplification and organisation (ESO) are the three pillars of purpose, especially for long-range purposes or complex goals.
