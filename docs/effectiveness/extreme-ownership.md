**EXTREME OWNERSHIP**

Lessons drawn from the book: _Extreme Ownership - How U.S. Navy Seals Lead and Win_ by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. [Click here for the Amazon purchase page](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057). However, this document also contains my own learnings and thoughts not necessarily derived from the book alone.

# The tie between leadership and individual pursuits
Leadership is about effectively guiding the pursuit of a goal as a team. An individual pursuit is about effectively guiding one's own pursuit of a goal. In both cases, the principles of decision-making apply, except that leading a team involves other principles or a further expansion of the same principles to account for factors specific to teamwork (e.g. division of labour, chain of command, etc.). I shall point out if a principle is actually a more general decision-making principle, or if a leadership principle can be generalised for decision-making, or if a leadership principle has a counterpart in an individual context.
