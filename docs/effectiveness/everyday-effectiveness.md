# Reducing to simplicity
## Principle
Break goals down to _simple units of complexity_.

## Explanation
**Abbreviation**: Unit of Complexity = UOC

Something complex is something made of two or more _interrelated units_\*; "complexity" refers to the coexistence of these interrelated units. Now, we grasp things and their relationships through _mental units_\*\*, and too much complexity is when there are more mental units than we can keep within our focus at once. A UOC is a mental unit (e.g. a symbol, a word, a statement) that refers to something complex. A _simple_ UOC is a UOC that was too complex before but now can be easily understood and applied (i.e. that can be tied to a broader context and tied to concretes).

---

\* **Unit**: A member of a group of similar things.

\*\* **Mental unit**: A discrete part of the mind (e.g. a thought, feeling, memory, etc.).

## Examples
1.<br>
For a child to grasp the concept of "multiplication", it must be broken down to addition, a simpler UOC. If she does not grasp addition either, it must be broken down to counting, an even simpler UOC.

2.<br>
Consider the concept of "science". We can break it down as:

```
                    science
                       |
      +----------------+--------------+
      |                |              |
  evidence <-------> logic <------> method
      |                |              |
  * observation      * axioms       * step
  * experimentation  * principles   * process
  * information                     * order
```

# Purposeful goals
## Principle
A goal without a goal ends up purposeless, inspiring no will.

## Explanation
A human is a goal-driven being; to a human, there can be no act without will, and no will without goals. Logically, the same applies to goal-seeking itself; to a human, there can be no goal without a broader goal, and no broader goal without a self-sustaining goal, i.e. an end in itself.

What is an end in itself? Can there be more than one? These are deep questions that deserve deep, i.e. philosophical reasoning. Drawing from my reasoning in [_The Standard of Value_ from **Ethics** from **Philosophy**](https://pranigopu.github.io/philosophy/ethics/1-standard-of-value.html) (not my original idea, but one I have reasoned first-hand), the only end in itself is life; to a human, this means life lived as a human, i.e. one driven not just by self-sustaining action but by self-sustaining volition. Hence, to revise my earlier point, there can be no goal without a broader goal, and no broader goal without life lived as a volitional being.

## Examples
Consider: why am I writing this? If there is no goal behind it, I am acting purposelessly such action cannot be sustained for long volitionally. No, I write because I want to be clear about how a goal can be sustained volitionally, and by writing, I (1) lay out my ideas where I can see them, without them going out of focus or being forgotten, and (2) make a longer logical chain of arguments easier to build, refer back to and thus validate. Now, why do I want clarity? Sometimes, the desire to gain clarity can feel like an urge, but I see that my urge draws from my grasp of the importance of ideas in my life, and thus the importance of being clear about my ideas. Here, we can see how it ties to my life itself, the end in itself.

# Full engagement
## Principle
Focus is limited; to divide it without reason is to waste a precious resource.

What does it mean to divide focus without reason?

- Indulging in arbitrary considerations
- Arbitrarily going against your knowledge and reasoning
- Responding to arbitrary urges

In short, to place the arbitrary above the rational.

## Explanation
Reason is the fundamental value, and rationality the fundamental virtue. Why? Consider: what is anti-reason? Reason is the power that takes what is given by the senses and ties it together, identifying entities, actions and relationships, and putting them together to identify systems. Thus, that which is anti-reason rejects our best efforts to know reality. Hence, that which is anti-reason is anti-knowledge and thus anti-life, because how are we to live well if we blind ourselves? Thus, as St. Thomas Aquinas said, "Every will at variance with reason, whether right or erring, is always evil."

## Examples
Suppose I am listening to someone, and I miss some point they made earlier, which I have no reason to think was too important right now. But I am not certain. Suppose my uncertainty made me try to remember the missed point, just to make sure I did not miss something that could important right now. What is the likely result? My rumination would result in my focus being divided as I listen to the speaker, losing more information as time goes by, adding more to the list of points I missed. Is this an effective way to listen to someone? No, for a few reasons, but at root, because it divides focus irrationally.

Suppose I am preparing for a project. What if I study every topic even tangentially related to my project, just because I think it could be relevant? Most likely, I will (1) cover far fewer topics, (2) cover less relevant topics, and (3) expend much my time and energy with little-to-no effect. What is the likely result? Slow progress, mental and physical overload, and potentially, burnout. Is this an effective way to prepare for a project? No, because it divides focus irrationally.

# Interrelation between the above
Simplicity clarifies goals.

Goals drive engagement.

Full engagement leads to:

- Simplicity in focus
- Efficacy in action
