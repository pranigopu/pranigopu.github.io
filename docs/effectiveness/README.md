# Effectiveness
## Introduction
"Effectiveness" concerns with the broad principles of effective action, often drawing from specific cases, experiences and/or pursuits. But "effectiveness" also concerns with broad principles within particular fields (e.g. programming, writing, etc.), which may be applicable more widely but are not necessarily so. In this directory, I aim to write about, discuss and explore such principles of effectiveness, both general and area-specific.
