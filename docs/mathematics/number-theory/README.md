# Number Theory
## Introduction
Number theory is the study of integers, more precisely the study of the properties of and relationships between integers. Interestingly, one can find its applications in computer science, e.g. cryptography (e.g. the RSA algorithm), pseudorandom number generation, error detection and correction in communication signals (e.g. the Hamming code), etc.
