# Mathematical Thinking
## Introduction
Mathematical thinking is the approach to thinking wherein:

- The cognitive context is explicit and well-defined
- Concepts are defined and termed precisely and unambiguously
- Expressions have consistent and well-defined forms

In essence, mathematical thinking is to ensure precision and clarity in measurement.

**NOTE**: _Measurement here refers to any form of abstract comparison._
