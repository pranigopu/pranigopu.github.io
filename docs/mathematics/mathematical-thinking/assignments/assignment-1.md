# 1

# 2
## a

## b
_Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it._

# 3
_No head injury is too trivial to ignore._

The alternative meaning that can be drawn is: the lack of head injury is too trivial to ignore, implying that the lack of head injury must be looked into due to its triviality. A reformulation to make the intended meaning clear:

A head injury is never too trivial to ignore.

# 4
_In case of fire, do not use elevator._

The first meaning is: if a fire occurs, do not use the elevator. The second meaning is: do not use the elevator, since a fire may occur (this implies a preventative measure rather than a measure to be taken in the case of an actual fire). The meanings are based on the two ways "in case" can be used: in the first way, "in case" means "if", in the second way, "in case" means "given the chance that". A reformulation to make the intended meaning clear:

If fire occurs, do not use elevator.

# 5
The statement "This page is left intentionally blank" conveys to the reader that the page is intentionally left devoid of information relevant to the purpose of the document; hence, "blank" here does not mean literally blank, only blank with respect to relevant information. "Blank" here could also refer not to the page as a whole but to the page apart from this printed statement. However, logically, given the meaning of "blank" and given the fact that the page is referred to as a whole, the statement is self-contradictory, since it being printed on a page makes the page no longer blank. Two reformulations of this statement to avoid such a logical problem:

**1.**

The rest of this page is intentionally left blank.

**2.**

This page intentionally lacks information relevant to the document's purpose.

# 7
_The temperature is hot today._

"Hot" is an adjective that describes the relative temperature of an object or substance. Hence, temperature, which is an attribute of which "hot" is a measure, cannot itself be hot. Hence, the given statement is logically invalid. However, to reformulate the statement to convey the intended meaning:

- It is hot today.
- The temperature is high today.

# 8
To show that not every number of the form $N = p_1 p_2 ... p_n + 1$ is a prime (given that $p_1, p_2 ... p_n$ are all primes), we only need to show one example of such a number that is not prime.
