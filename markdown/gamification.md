# Introduction
Gamification is the application of elements of game design to contexts that are not inherently game-based. A key aspect of gamification is to reframe a non-game context as a game-based context. The purpose of gamification is to integrate aspects of human motivation in a practical setting while retaining the functional aspects of the setting. The reason for focusing on aspects of human motivation is that motivation is the concretisation of value, and since value is the basis for purpose, not being able to concretise the value of a task naturally diminishes, degrades or even destroys a human's ability to act purposefully toward the task's completion.

To add to this, self-determination theory (SDT) is based on the assumption that naturally, individuals actively orient themselves toward growth and self-organisation. In other words, people strive to understand and expand their own efficacy in life by integrating new experiences, cultivating their needs, desires, and interests, and connecting with others and the outside world. However, SDT also asserts that people can become controlled, fragmented, and alienated if their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are undermined by a motivationally deÔ¨Åcient environment.

These aspects are relevant to consider, because the value of a task can often be more long-range or bigger-picture (e.g. health and fitness, the study of abstract subjects like mathematics, the development of a complex skill such as programming, etc.). Moreover, some tasks, while important to an individual, may have goals that are hard to tie strongly to his personal values; for example, the work of an employee, while valuable to his livelihood, may not be directly in line with his personal goals and interests in other respects that are more direct and immediate. In all the above cases, having the means to concretise value apart from the inherent value of the task can be of great benefit. Understanding this, the value of gamification becomes more apparent. This essay explores how gamification principles are being integrated into diverse sectors, analysing their effectiveness and potential future implications for society and technology.

# Conceptual Framework of Gamification
The Octalysis framework, developed by Yu-Kai Chou, is a comprehensive framework for understanding the main drives of gamification, namely (1) epic meaning and calling, (2) development and accomplishment, (3) empowerment of creativity and feedback, (4) ownership and possession, (5) social influence and relatedness, (6) scarcity and impatience, (7) unpredictability and curiosity, and (8) loss and avoidance.

These drives can be classified in two ways: (1) extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivators, and (2) black hat vs. white hat drives (Chou, no date). Extrinsic motivators are the goals that drive someone to act, whereas intrinsic motivators are the self-contained rewards of the actions by themselves. Black hat drives are elements that create a sense of urgency, obsession and/or fear of loss, whereas white hat drives are elements that create a sense of well-being, meaning and/or happiness. No drive is inherently undesirable, since any particular drive is effective in achieving a particular desired effect; thus, it is the context and the purpose of a system that decides what drives would work best to gamify the system.

# Non-Game Applications of Game Concepts
Learning can be inherently engaging, but can also involve stretches of dry material and unengaging exercises.To overcome such challenges to learning, gamification principles have often been used, such as in applications like Kahoot, Duolingo and Brilliant.org. To explore an example, consider the language-learning application Duolingo. It involves extrinsic motivators, such as daily quests and weekly friendship quests, and intrinsic motivators such as mini-games (e.g. timed word matching and interactive stories). It involves black hat drives such as streaks, time-bound quests and ranked leaderboards. But it also has white hat drives such as achievements and community interaction (e.g. celebration of achievements by friends). The integration of a variety of gamification drives help ensure that different users (who may be motivated by different drives) keep learning through the application.

Productive work is vital to human survival and can be inherently motivating, but similar to learning, it can also often involve tedium and uninviting objectives. To address these challenges, applications like Habitica and Life RPG employ gamification principles to motivate objective completion, integrating a variety of gamification drives to encourage both urgency-driven consistency (e.g. task tracking) and enjoyment-based motivation (e.g. unlocking in-game rewards, encouraging community participation, etc.). Findings from Gerdenitsch et al. (2020) showed positive effects of gamification (using Habitica) on work enjoyment and on productivity for employees with leadership responsibilities.

However, gamifying objective completion extends beyond productive work and onto other areas of life, such as health/fitness goals, learning/study goals, daily tasks, event organisation, etc. While platforms like Habitica and Life RPG apply in these areas too, there are more specialised platforms, such as Fitbit (the application along with the tracking devices) for fitness. But there is also scope for gamifying larger-scale objective completion, e.g. in rural/urban planning and ecological/environmental development.

As one example, the Indian Ministry of Panchayati Raj proposed the use of drone site survey maps and geographic information system (GIS) data to gamify village development plans for the locals, so as to increase local engagement in rural planning and thus improve local governance (Engineer's Planet, 2024). To this end, the proposed game replicates road-building, drainage and street lighting. By including rural people in the planning process, this proposal hopes to enable more efficient local government and better use of resources. Helping users to create thorough development plans, the game will replicate road building, drainage, and street lighting.

As another example, the game "Cool Choices" (Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council, no date; Douglas and Brauer, 2021) is a game wherein players compete in teams to reduce energy usage over a 4-6 week period; points can be claimed by engaging in one-time or recurring sustainable behaviours. An evaluation of two large-scale field studies on the effect of "Cool Choices" on sustainable habits (with a total of 1975 samples) revealed that playing this game led to long-term reductions (i.e. at least six months after the game) in electricity consumption, especially among individuals who initially consumed high amounts of energy (Michael et al., 2017).


# Conclusion
The theoretical foundations established in the introduction, combined with a general grasp of the effectiveness of games in driving motivation as well as real-life examples of successful and proposed applications of gamification principles, show the relevance, reality and potential of applying game concepts to non-game contexts. However, gamification is not without potential pitfalls, such as over-reliance on extrinsic motivators or addiction-like behaviours from black hat techniques; these pitfalls can be observed in gaming, and thus can naturally extend to the application of game concepts. This underscores the importance of rational and thoughtful gamification, involving not just effective game design but also psychological, ethical and long-range considerations.
